       "'[Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811]\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\n\\nThe family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.\\nTheir estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,\\nin the centre of their property, where, for many generations,\\nthey had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage\\nthe general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.\\nThe late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived\\nto a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,\\nhad a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.\\nBut her death, which happened ten years before his own,\\nproduced a great alteration in his home; for to supply\\nher loss, he invited and received into his house the family\\nof his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor\\nof the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended\\nto bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece,\\nand their children, the old Gentleman\\'s days were\\ncomfortably spent.  His attachment to them all increased.\\nThe constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood\\nto his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,\\nbut from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness\\nof the children added a relish to his existence.\\n\\nBy a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one\\nson: by his present lady, three daughters.  The son,\\na steady respectable young man, was amply provided\\nfor by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.\\nBy his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,\\nhe added to his wealth.  To him therefore the succession\\nto the Norland estate was not so really important as to\\nhis sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might\\narise to them from their father\\'s inheriting that property,\\ncould be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;\\nfor the remaining moiety of his first wife\\'s fortune was\\nalso secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest\\nin it.\\n\\nThe old gentleman died: his will was read, and\\nlike almost every other will, gave as much disappointment\\nas pleasure.  He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,\\nas to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him\\non such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.\\nMr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\\nwife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to\\nhis son, and his son\\'s son, a child of four years old,\\nit was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself\\nno power of providing for those who were most dear\\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge\\non the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.\\nThe whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,\\nin occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,\\nhad so far gained on the affections of his uncle,\\nby such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\nof two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,\\nan earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,\\nand a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value\\nof all the attention which, for years, he had received\\nfrom his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to\\nbe unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection\\nfor the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s disappointment was, at first, severe;\\nbut his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might\\nreasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,\\nlay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate\\nalready large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.\\nBut the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his\\nonly one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer;\\nand ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,\\nwas all that remained for his widow and daughters.\\n\\nHis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,\\nand to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength\\nand urgency which illness could command, the interest\\nof his mother-in-law and sisters.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the\\nrest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation\\nof such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do\\nevery thing in his power to make them comfortable.\\nHis father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\nand Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how\\nmuch there might prudently be in his power to do for them.\\n\\nHe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to\\nbe rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be\\nill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;\\nfor he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge\\nof his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman,\\nhe might have been made still more respectable than he\\nwas:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he\\nwas very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.\\nBut Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--\\nmore narrow-minded and selfish.\\n\\nWhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated\\nwithin himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters\\nby the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.  He then\\nreally thought himself equal to it.  The prospect of four\\nthousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother\\'s fortune,\\nwarmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--\\n\"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would\\nbe liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make\\nthem completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he could\\nspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--\\nHe thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,\\nand he did not repent.\\n\\nNo sooner was his father\\'s funeral over, than Mrs. John\\nDashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her\\nmother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.\\nNo one could dispute her right to come; the house was\\nher husband\\'s from the moment of his father\\'s decease;\\nbut the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,\\nand to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s situation, with only\\ncommon feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--\\nbut in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,\\na generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,\\nby whomsoever given or received, was to her a source\\nof immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never\\nbeen a favourite with any of her husband\\'s family;\\nbut she had had no opportunity, till the present,\\nof shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\\nof other people she could act when occasion required it.\\n\\nSo acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious\\nbehaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her\\ndaughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,\\nshe would have quitted the house for ever, had not the\\nentreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect\\non the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all\\nher three children determined her afterwards to stay,\\nand for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.\\n\\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was\\nso effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,\\nand coolness of judgment, which qualified her,\\nthough only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,\\nand enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage\\nof them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood\\nwhich must generally have led to imprudence.  She had\\nan excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,\\nand her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;\\nand which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s abilities were, in many respects,\\nquite equal to Elinor\\'s. She was sensible and clever;\\nbut eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have\\nno moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she\\nwas everything but prudent.  The resemblance between\\nher and her mother was strikingly great.\\n\\nElinor saw, with concern, the excess of her\\nsister\\'s sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued\\nand cherished.  They encouraged each other now in the\\nviolence of their affliction.  The agony of grief\\nwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,\\nwas sought for, was created again and again.  They gave\\nthemselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase\\nof wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,\\nand resolved against ever admitting consolation\\nin future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still\\nshe could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could\\nconsult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law\\non her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\\nand could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,\\nand encourage her to similar forbearance.\\n\\nMargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,\\nwell-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed\\na good deal of Marianne\\'s romance, without having\\nmuch of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\\nto equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress\\nof Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded\\nto the condition of visitors.  As such, however, they were\\ntreated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband\\nwith as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really\\npressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland\\nas their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible\\nto Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could\\naccommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,\\nhis invitation was accepted.\\n\\nA continuance in a place where everything reminded\\nher of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.\\nIn seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful\\nthan hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine\\nexpectation of happiness which is happiness itself.\\nBut in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was\\nbeyond alloy.\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her\\nhusband intended to do for his sisters.  To take three\\nthousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy\\nwould be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.\\nShe begged him to think again on the subject.  How could\\nhe answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only\\nchild too, of so large a sum?  And what possible claim\\ncould the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by\\nhalf blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,\\nhave on his generosity to so large an amount.  It was very\\nwell known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages;\\nand why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry,\\nby giving away all his money to his half sisters?\\n\\n\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied\\nher husband, \"that I should assist his widow and daughters.\"\\n\\n\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say;\\nten to one but he was light-headed at the time.\\nHad he been in his right senses, he could not have thought\\nof such a thing as begging you to give away half your\\nfortune from your own child.\"\\n\\n\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum,\\nmy dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,\\nto assist them, and make their situation more comfortable\\nthan it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would\\nhave been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.\\nHe could hardly suppose I should neglect them.\\nBut as he required the promise, I could not do less\\nthan give it; at least I thought so at the time.\\nThe promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.\\nSomething must be done for them whenever they leave Norland\\nand settle in a new home.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, LET something be done for them;\\nbut THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.\\nConsider,\" she added, \"that when the money is once\\nparted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will marry,\\nand it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could\\nbe restored to our poor little boy--\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely,\\n\"that would make great difference.  The time may come when\\nHarry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.\\nIf he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would\\nbe a very convenient addition.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it would.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties,\\nif the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds\\nwould be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth\\nwould do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY\\nhis sisters!  And as it is--only half blood!--But you\\nhave such a generous spirit!\"\\n\\n\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.\\n\"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than\\ntoo little.  No one, at least, can think I have not\\ndone enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly\\nexpect more.\"\\n\\n\"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\"\\nsaid the lady, \"but we are not to think of their\\nexpectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five\\nhundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, without any addition\\nof mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds\\non their mother\\'s death--a very comfortable fortune\\nfor any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that\\nthey can want no addition at all.  They will have ten\\nthousand pounds divided amongst them.  If they marry,\\nthey will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,\\nthey may all live very comfortably together on the interest\\nof ten thousand pounds.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether,\\nupon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do\\nsomething for their mother while she lives, rather than\\nfor them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters\\nwould feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\nA hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\nHis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving\\nher consent to this plan.\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with\\nfifteen hundred pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood\\nshould live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"\\n\\n\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot\\nbe worth half that purchase.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always\\nlive for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;\\nand she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.\\nAn annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\\nand over every year, and there is no getting rid\\nof it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.\\nI have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;\\nfor my mother was clogged with the payment of three\\nto old superannuated servants by my father\\'s will,\\nand it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.\\nTwice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then\\nthere was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one\\nof them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned\\nout to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.\\nHer income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual\\nclaims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,\\nbecause, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at\\nmy mother\\'s disposal, without any restriction whatever.\\nIt has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am\\nsure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\nall the world.\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood,\\n\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.\\nOne\\'s fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one\\'s own.\\nTo be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,\\non every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away\\none\\'s independence.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.\\nThey think themselves secure, you do no more than what\\nis expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you,\\nwhatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.\\nI would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.\\nIt may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,\\nor even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better\\nthat there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I\\nmay give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\\nthan a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge\\ntheir style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,\\nand would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\\nof the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.\\nA present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent\\ntheir ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,\\nbe amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,\\nI am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\\nof your giving them any money at all.  The assistance\\nhe thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be\\nreasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking\\nout for a comfortable small house for them, helping them\\nto move their things, and sending them presents of fish\\nand game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.\\nI\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.\\nDo but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively\\ncomfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live\\non the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the\\nthousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings\\nthem in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,\\nthey will pay their mother for their board out of it.\\nAltogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,\\nand what on earth can four women want for more than\\nthat?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will\\nbe nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,\\nand hardly any servants; they will keep no company,\\nand can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive\\nhow comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am\\nsure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;\\nand as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think\\nof it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you\\nare perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean\\nnothing more by his request to me than what you say.\\nI clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\\nto them as you have described.  When my mother removes\\ninto another house my services shall be readily given\\nto accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present\\nof furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however,\\nONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother\\nmoved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill\\nwas sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,\\nand is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore\\nbe almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\\n\\n\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.\\nA valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would\\nhave been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice\\nas handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great\\ndeal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY\\ncan ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.\\nYour father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this:\\nthat you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention\\nto his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,\\nhe would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"\\n\\nThis argument was irresistible.  It gave to his\\nintentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he\\nfinally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,\\nif not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow\\nand children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly\\nacts as his own wife pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;\\nnot from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\\nwell known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\\nproduced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,\\nand her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\\nof heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,\\nshe was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries\\nfor a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;\\nfor to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.\\nBut she could hear of no situation that at once answered\\nher notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence\\nof her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected\\nseveral houses as too large for their income, which her\\nmother would have approved.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\\nsolemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,\\nwhich gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.\\nShe doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\\nhad doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters\\'\\nsake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would\\nsupport her in affluence.  For their brother\\'s sake, too,\\nfor the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she\\nreproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,\\nin believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive\\nbehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\ntheir welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,\\nshe firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.\\n\\nThe contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,\\nfelt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased\\nby the farther knowledge of her character, which half\\na year\\'s residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\\nin spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\\naffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long,\\nhad not a particular circumstance occurred to give\\nstill greater eligibility, according to the opinions\\nof Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters\\' continuance at Norland.\\n\\nThis circumstance was a growing attachment between\\nher eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,\\na gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced\\nto their acquaintance soon after his sister\\'s establishment\\nat Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part\\nof his time there.\\n\\nSome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\\nmotives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son\\nof a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed\\nit from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,\\nthe whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.\\nBut Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.\\nIt was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\\nthat he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned\\nthe partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of\\nher\\'s that difference of fortune should keep any couple\\nasunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;\\nand that Elinor\\'s merit should not be acknowledged\\nby every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\\n\\nEdward Ferrars was not recommended to their good\\nopinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.\\nHe was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy\\nto make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice\\nto himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open,\\naffectionate heart.  His understanding was good,\\nand his education had given it solid improvement.\\nBut he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\\nto answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed\\nto see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.\\nThey wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\\nmanner or other.  His mother wished to interest him in\\npolitical concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see\\nhim connected with some of the great men of the day.\\nMrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,\\ntill one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would\\nhave quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.\\nBut Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.\\nAll his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\\nof private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother\\nwho was more promising.\\n\\nEdward had been staying several weeks in the house\\nbefore he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s attention;\\nfor she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered\\nher careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he\\nwas quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.\\nHe did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\\nill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe\\nand approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor\\nchanced one day to make on the difference between him\\nand his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him\\nmost forcibly to her mother.\\n\\n\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike\\nFanny is enough.  It implies everything amiable.\\nI love him already.\"\\n\\n\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you\\nknow more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile.\\n\"I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.\"\\n\\n\"You may esteem him.\"\\n\\n\"I have never yet known what it was to separate\\nesteem and love.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.\\nHer manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.\\nShe speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion\\nof his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;\\nbut she really felt assured of his worth: and even that\\nquietness of manner, which militated against all her\\nestablished ideas of what a young man\\'s address ought to be,\\nwas no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be\\nwarm and his temper affectionate.\\n\\nNo sooner did she perceive any symptom of love\\nin his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their\\nserious attachment as certain, and looked forward\\nto their marriage as rapidly approaching.\\n\\n\"In a few months, my dear Marianne.\" said she,\\n\"Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.\\nWe shall miss her; but SHE will be happy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"\\n\\n\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.\\nWe shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall\\nmeet every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother,\\na real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion\\nin the world of Edward\\'s heart.  But you look grave,\\nMarianne; do you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it\\nwith some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love\\nhim tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young\\nman--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;\\nit has none of that grace which I should expect\\nin the man who could seriously attach my sister.\\nHis eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once\\nannounce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this,\\nI am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems\\nscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor\\'s\\ndrawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person\\nwho can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of\\nhis frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\\nhe knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,\\nnot as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters\\nmust be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose\\ntaste did not in every point coincide with my own.\\nHe must enter into all my feelings; the same books,\\nthe same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how spiritless,\\nhow tame was Edward\\'s manner in reading to us last night!\\nI felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it\\nwith so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.\\nI could hardly keep my seat.  To hear those beautiful lines\\nwhich have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced\\nwith such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"--\\n\\n\"He would certainly have done more justice to\\nsimple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;\\nbut you WOULD give him Cowper.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--\\nbut we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor has\\nnot my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and\\nbe happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,\\nhad I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\\nMama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced\\nthat I shall never see a man whom I can really love.\\nI require so much!  He must have all Edward\\'s virtues,\\nand his person and manners must ornament his goodness\\nwith every possible charm.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.\\nIt is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.\\nWhy should you be less fortunate than your mother?  In\\none circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be\\ndifferent from her\\'s!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\n\\n\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne,\\n\"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\"\\n\\n\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should\\nyou think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has\\ngreat pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,\\nand I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,\\nthough he has not had opportunities of improving it.\\nHad he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would\\nhave drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment\\nin such matters so much, that he is always unwilling\\nto give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate\\npropriety and simplicity of taste, which in general\\ndirect him perfectly right.\"\\n\\nMarianne was afraid of offending, and said no more\\non the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor\\ndescribed as excited in him by the drawings of other\\npeople, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,\\nin her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though\\nsmiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured\\nher sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\\n\\n\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not\\nconsider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think\\nI may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him\\nis perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,\\nI am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\\n\\nMarianne hardly knew what to say.  She would\\nnot wound the feelings of her sister on any account,\\nand yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.\\nAt length she replied:\\n\\n\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him\\nis not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.\\nI have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\\npropensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,\\nas you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world\\nof his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is\\nworthy and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile,\\n\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\\nwith such commendation as that.  I do not perceive\\nhow you could express yourself more warmly.\"\\n\\nMarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\\n\\n\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor,\\n\"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him\\noften enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.\\nThe excellence of his understanding and his principles\\ncan be concealed only by that shyness which too often\\nkeeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice\\nto his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities,\\nas you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\\nbeen kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have\\nbeen at times thrown a good deal together, while you\\nhave been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\\nprinciple by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,\\nhave studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\\nsubjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\\nI venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,\\nenjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,\\nhis observation just and correct, and his taste delicate\\nand pure.  His abilities in every respect improve\\nas much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\\nAt first sight, his address is certainly not striking;\\nand his person can hardly be called handsome, till the\\nexpression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,\\nand the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.\\nAt present, I know him so well, that I think him\\nreally handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you,\\nMarianne?\"\\n\\n\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I\\ndo not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,\\nI shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do\\nin his heart.\"\\n\\nElinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for\\nthe warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.\\nShe felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.\\nShe believed the regard to be mutual; but she required\\ngreater certainty of it to make Marianne\\'s conviction\\nof their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that\\nwhat Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,\\nthey believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,\\nand to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain the real\\nstate of the case to her sister.\\n\\n\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think\\nvery highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\\n\\nMarianne here burst forth with indignation--\\n\\n\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!\\nworse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.\\nUse those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.\"\\n\\nElinor could not help laughing.  \"Excuse me,\"\\nsaid she; \"and be assured that I meant no offence to you,\\nby speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.\\nBelieve them to be stronger than I have declared;\\nbelieve them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\\nsuspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,\\nwithout imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must\\nnot believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.\\nThere are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;\\nand till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder\\nat my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,\\nby believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart\\nI feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.\\nBut there are other points to be considered besides\\nhis inclination.  He is very far from being independent.\\nWhat his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny\\'s\\noccasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have\\nnever been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very\\nmuch mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there\\nwould be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish\\nto marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\\nhigh rank.\"\\n\\nMarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination\\nof her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.\\n\\n\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.\\n\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages\\nwill proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon,\\nand Edward will have greater opportunity of improving\\nthat natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.\\nOh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to\\nlearn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"\\n\\nElinor had given her real opinion to her sister.\\nShe could not consider her partiality for Edward\\nin so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.\\nThere was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,\\nif it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost\\nas unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him\\nto feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.\\nIt would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind\\nwhich frequently attended him.  A more reasonable cause\\nmight be found in the dependent situation which forbade\\nthe indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother\\nneither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable\\nat present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form\\na home for himself, without strictly attending to her views\\nfor his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,\\nit was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.\\nShe was far from depending on that result of his preference\\nof her, which her mother and sister still considered\\nas certain.  Nay, the longer they were together the more\\ndoubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,\\nfor a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\\nthan friendship.\\n\\nBut, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,\\nwhen perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,\\nand at the same time, (which was still more common,)\\nto make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of\\naffronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to\\nher so expressively of her brother\\'s great expectations,\\nof Mrs. Ferrars\\'s resolution that both her sons should\\nmarry well, and of the danger attending any young woman\\nwho attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could\\nneither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.\\nShe gave her an answer which marked her contempt,\\nand instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might\\nbe the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,\\nher beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week\\nto such insinuations.\\n\\nIn this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered\\nto her from the post, which contained a proposal\\nparticularly well timed.  It was the offer of a small house,\\non very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,\\na gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.\\nThe letter was from this gentleman himself, and written\\nin the true spirit of friendly accommodation.\\nHe understood that she was in need of a dwelling;\\nand though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which\\nshe might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.\\nHe earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars\\nof the house and garden, to come with her daughters to\\nBarton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence\\nshe might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the\\nhouses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,\\nbe made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\\nin so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\\nto his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\\nnearer connections.  She needed no time for deliberation\\nor inquiry.  Her resolution was formed as she read.\\nThe situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from\\nSussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,\\nwould have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\\npossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its\\nfirst recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland\\nwas no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;\\nit was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing\\nher daughter-in-law\\'s guest; and to remove for ever\\nfrom that beloved place would be less painful than to\\ninhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.\\nShe instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment\\nof his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\\nand then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,\\nthat she might be secure of their approbation before her\\nanswer were sent.\\n\\nElinor had always thought it would be more prudent\\nfor them to settle at some distance from Norland,\\nthan immediately amongst their present acquaintance.\\nOn THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\\nher mother\\'s intention of removing into Devonshire.\\nThe house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so\\nsimple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,\\nas to leave her no right of objection on either point;\\nand, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought\\nany charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from\\nthe vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made\\nno attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter\\nof acquiescence.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood\\nindulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her\\nson-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,\\nand should incommode them no longer than till every thing were\\nready for her inhabiting it.  They heard her with surprise.\\nMrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly\\nhoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\\nShe had great satisfaction in replying that she was going\\ninto Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her,\\non hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,\\nwhich required no explanation to her, repeated,\\n\"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?  So far from hence!\\nAnd to what part of it?\"  She explained the situation.\\nIt was within four miles northward of Exeter.\\n\\n\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope\\nto see many of my friends in it.  A room or two can\\neasily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty\\nin travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find\\nnone in accommodating them.\"\\n\\nShe concluded with a very kind invitation to\\nMr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;\\nand to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.\\nThough her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had\\nmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than\\nwas unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect\\non her in that point to which it principally tended.\\nTo separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her\\nobject as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nby this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she\\ndisregarded her disapprobation of the match.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again\\nhow exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\\nsuch a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any\\nservice to her in removing her furniture.  He really felt\\nconscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion\\nto which he had limited the performance of his promise to\\nhis father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--\\nThe furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly\\nconsisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,\\nwith a handsome pianoforte of Marianne\\'s.  Mrs. John\\nDashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could\\nnot help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood\\'s income\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own,\\nshe should have any handsome article of furniture.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was\\nready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.\\nNo difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she\\nwaited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland,\\nand to determine her future household, before she set\\noff for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid\\nin the performance of everything that interested her,\\nwas soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband\\nhad been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity\\nnow offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed\\nto sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her\\neldest daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she\\nconsulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;\\nbut the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom\\ntoo limited the number of their servants to three;\\ntwo maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided\\nfrom amongst those who had formed their establishment\\nat Norland.\\n\\nThe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately\\ninto Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress\\'s\\narrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown\\nto Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the\\ncottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied\\nso undoubtingly on Sir John\\'s description of the house,\\nas to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she\\nentered it as her own.  Her eagerness to be gone from Norland\\nwas preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction\\nof her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;\\na satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\\nunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\\nNow was the time when her son-in-law\\'s promise to his\\nfather might with particular propriety be fulfilled.\\nSince he had neglected to do it on first coming to\\nthe estate, their quitting his house might be looked\\non as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.\\nBut Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every\\nhope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general\\ndrift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no\\nfarther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.\\nHe so frequently talked of the increasing expenses\\nof housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,\\nwhich a man of any consequence in the world was beyond\\ncalculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand\\nin need of more money himself than to have any design of\\ngiving money away.\\n\\nIn a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir\\nJohn Middleton\\'s first letter to Norland, every thing was\\nso far settled in their future abode as to enable\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.\\n\\nMany were the tears shed by them in their last\\nadieus to a place so much beloved.  \"Dear, dear Norland!\"\\nsaid Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,\\non the last evening of their being there; \"when shall I cease\\nto regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!\\nhappy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing\\nyou from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view\\nyou no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you\\nwill continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we\\nare removed, nor any branch become motionless although we\\ncan observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;\\nunconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,\\nand insensible of any change in those who walk under your\\nshade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\n\\nThe first part of their journey was performed in too\\nmelancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious\\nand unpleasant.  But as they drew towards the end of it,\\ntheir interest in the appearance of a country which they\\nwere to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of\\nBarton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.\\nIt was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich\\nin pasture.  After winding along it for more than a mile,\\nthey reached their own house.  A small green court was\\nthe whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate\\nadmitted them into it.\\n\\nAs a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable\\nand compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the\\nbuilding was regular, the roof was tiled, the window\\nshutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered\\nwith honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through\\nthe house into the garden behind.  On each side of the\\nentrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;\\nand beyond them were the offices and the stairs.\\nFour bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.\\nIt had not been built many years and was in good repair.\\nIn comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered\\nthe house were soon dried away.  They were cheered\\nby the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each\\nfor the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\\nIt was very early in September; the season was fine,\\nand from first seeing the place under the advantage\\nof good weather, they received an impression in its\\nfavour which was of material service in recommending\\nit to their lasting approbation.\\n\\nThe situation of the house was good.  High hills rose\\nimmediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;\\nsome of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.\\nThe village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,\\nand formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.\\nThe prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the\\nwhole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.\\nThe hills which surrounded the cottage terminated\\nthe valley in that direction; under another name,\\nand in another course, it branched out again between two\\nof the steepest of them.\\n\\nWith the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood\\nwas upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former\\nstyle of life rendered many additions to the latter\\nindispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;\\nand she had at this time ready money enough to supply all\\nthat was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.\\n\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is\\ntoo small for our family, but we will make ourselves\\ntolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late\\nin the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring,\\nif I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\\nthink about building.  These parlors are both too small\\nfor such parties of our friends as I hope to see often\\ncollected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the\\npassage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,\\nand so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;\\nthis, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,\\nand a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\\nlittle cottage.  I could wish the stairs were handsome.\\nBut one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it\\nwould be no difficult matter to widen them.  I shall see\\nhow much I am before-hand with the world in the spring,\\nand we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\\n\\nIn the mean time, till all these alterations could\\nbe made from the savings of an income of five hundred\\na-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were\\nwise enough to be contented with the house as it was;\\nand each of them was busy in arranging their particular\\nconcerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books\\nand other possessions, to form themselves a home.\\nMarianne\\'s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;\\nand Elinor\\'s drawings were affixed to the walls of their\\nsitting room.\\n\\nIn such employments as these they were interrupted\\nsoon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of\\ntheir landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,\\nand to offer them every accommodation from his own house\\nand garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.\\nSir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.\\nHe had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long\\nfor his young cousins to remember him.  His countenance\\nwas thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were\\nas friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival\\nseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort\\nto be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much\\nof his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\\nterms with his family, and pressed them so cordially\\nto dine at Barton Park every day till they were better\\nsettled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could\\nnot give offence.  His kindness was not confined to words;\\nfor within an hour after he left them, a large basket\\nfull of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,\\nwhich was followed before the end of the day by a present\\nof game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\\nletters to and from the post for them, and would not be\\ndenied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper\\nevery day.\\n\\nLady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him,\\ndenoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as\\nshe could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;\\nand as this message was answered by an invitation\\nequally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.\\n\\nThey were, of course, very anxious to see a person on\\nwhom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the\\nelegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.\\nLady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;\\nher face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\\nand her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance\\nwhich her husband\\'s wanted.  But they would have been\\nimproved by some share of his frankness and warmth;\\nand her visit was long enough to detract something from\\ntheir first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly\\nwell-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say\\nfor herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.\\n\\nConversation however was not wanted, for Sir John\\nwas very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise\\nprecaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine\\nlittle boy about six years old, by which means there was\\none subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case\\nof extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,\\nadmire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother\\nanswered for him, while he hung about her and held\\ndown his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,\\nwho wondered at his being so shy before company, as he\\ncould make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit\\na child ought to be of the party, by way of provision\\nfor discourse.  In the present case it took up ten minutes\\nto determine whether the boy were most like his father\\nor mother, and in what particular he resembled either,\\nfor of course every body differed, and every body was\\nastonished at the opinion of the others.\\n\\nAn opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods\\nof debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John\\nwould not leave the house without securing their promise\\nof dining at the park the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\n\\nBarton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.\\nThe ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,\\nbut it was screened from their view at home by the\\nprojection of a hill.  The house was large and handsome;\\nand the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\nand elegance.  The former was for Sir John\\'s gratification,\\nthe latter for that of his lady.  They were scarcely\\never without some friends staying with them in the house,\\nand they kept more company of every kind than any other\\nfamily in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to the\\nhappiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper\\nand outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other\\nin that total want of talent and taste which confined\\ntheir employments, unconnected with such as society produced,\\nwithin a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a sportsman,\\nLady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she\\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources.\\nLady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her\\nchildren all the year round, while Sir John\\'s independent\\nemployments were in existence only half the time.\\nContinual engagements at home and abroad, however,\\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;\\nsupported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise\\nto the good breeding of his wife.\\n\\nLady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance\\nof her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;\\nand from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment\\nin any of their parties.  But Sir John\\'s satisfaction\\nin society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold,\\nand the noisier they were the better was he pleased.\\nHe was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,\\nfor in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold\\nham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private\\nballs were numerous enough for any young lady who was not\\nsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.\\n\\nThe arrival of a new family in the country was always\\na matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was\\ncharmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his\\ncottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,\\nand unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion;\\nfor to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could\\nwant to make her mind as captivating as her person.\\nThe friendliness of his disposition made him happy in\\naccommodating those, whose situation might be considered,\\nin comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In showing\\nkindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only\\nin his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;\\nfor a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who\\nare sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging\\ntheir taste by admitting them to a residence within his own\\nmanor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door\\nof the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton\\nPark with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them\\nto the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern\\nwhich the same subject had drawn from him the day before,\\nat being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.\\nThey would see, he said, only one gentleman there\\nbesides himself; a particular friend who was staying at\\nthe park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.\\nHe hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,\\nand could assure them it should never happen so again.\\nHe had been to several families that morning in hopes\\nof procuring some addition to their number, but it\\nwas moonlight and every body was full of engagements.\\nLuckily Lady Middleton\\'s mother had arrived at Barton\\nwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful\\nagreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find\\nit so very dull as they might imagine.  The young ladies,\\nas well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with\\nhaving two entire strangers of the party, and wished for\\nno more.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton\\'s mother, was a\\ngood-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a\\ngreat deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.  She was full\\nof jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said\\nmany witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;\\nhoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.\\nMarianne was vexed at it for her sister\\'s sake, and turned\\nher eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,\\nwith an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than\\ncould arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings\\'s.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no\\nmore adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,\\nthan Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings\\nto be Lady Middleton\\'s mother.  He was silent and grave.\\nHis appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\\nof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret\\nan absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side\\nof five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,\\nhis countenance was sensible, and his address was\\nparticularly gentlemanlike.\\n\\nThere was nothing in any of the party which could\\nrecommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold\\ninsipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive,\\nthat in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,\\nand even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\\nmother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed\\nto be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her\\nfour noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,\\ntore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse\\nexcept what related to themselves.\\n\\nIn the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical,\\nshe was invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked,\\nevery body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,\\nwho sang very well, at their request went through the\\nchief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain\\never since in the same position on the pianoforte,\\nfor her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving\\nup music, although by her mother\\'s account, she had\\nplayed extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s performance was highly applauded.\\nSir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,\\nand as loud in his conversation with the others while every\\nsong lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,\\nwondered how any one\\'s attention could be diverted from music\\nfor a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song\\nwhich Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone,\\nof all the party, heard her without being in raptures.\\nHe paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt\\na respect for him on the occasion, which the others had\\nreasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.\\nHis pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that\\necstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible\\ninsensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough\\nto allow that a man of five and thirty might well have\\noutlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite\\npower of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make\\nevery allowance for the colonel\\'s advanced state of life\\nwhich humanity required.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.\\nShe had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived\\nto see respectably married, and she had now therefore\\nnothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.\\nIn the promotion of this object she was zealously active,\\nas far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity\\nof projecting weddings among all the young people\\nof her acquaintance.  She was remarkably quick in the\\ndiscovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage\\nof raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young\\nlady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;\\nand this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her\\narrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel\\nBrandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.\\nShe rather suspected it to be so, on the very first\\nevening of their being together, from his listening\\nso attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit\\nwas returned by the Middletons\\' dining at the cottage,\\nthe fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.\\nIt must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.\\nIt would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE\\nwas handsome.  Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see\\nColonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection\\nwith Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every\\npretty girl.\\n\\nThe immediate advantage to herself was by no means\\ninconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes\\nagainst them both.  At the park she laughed at the colonel,\\nand in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former her\\nraillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\\nperfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at\\nfirst incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,\\nshe hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,\\nor censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an\\nunfeeling reflection on the colonel\\'s advanced years,\\nand on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years\\nyounger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared\\nto the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear\\nMrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw\\nridicule on his age.\\n\\n\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity\\nof the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally\\nill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than\\nMrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father;\\nand if he were ever animated enough to be in love,\\nmust have long outlived every sensation of the kind.\\nIt is too ridiculous!  When is a man to be safe from such wit,\\nif age and infirmity will not protect him?\"\\n\\n\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon\\ninfirm?  I can easily suppose that his age may appear much\\ngreater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly\\ndeceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!\"\\n\\n\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?\\nand is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?\"\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing,\\n\"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay;\\nand it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been\\nextended to the advanced age of forty.\"\\n\\n\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well\\nthat Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends\\nyet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.\\nHe may live twenty years longer.  But thirty-five has\\nnothing to do with matrimony.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had\\nbetter not have any thing to do with matrimony together.\\nBut if there should by any chance happen to be a woman\\nwho is single at seven and twenty, I should not think\\nColonel Brandon\\'s being thirty-five any objection to his\\nmarrying HER.\"\\n\\n\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne,\\nafter pausing a moment, \"can never hope to feel or inspire\\naffection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,\\nor her fortune small, I can suppose that she might\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,\\nfor the sake of the provision and security of a wife.\\nIn his marrying such a woman therefore there would be\\nnothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of convenience,\\nand the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would\\nbe no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.\\nTo me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which\\neach wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\"\\n\\n\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could\\nfeel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough\\nto love, to make him a desirable companion to her.\\nBut I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and\\nhis wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,\\nmerely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a\\nvery cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one\\nof his shoulders.\"\\n\\n\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne;\\n\"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected\\nwith aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of\\nailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.\"\\n\\n\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not\\nhave despised him half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not\\nthere something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,\\nhollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"\\n\\nSoon after this, upon Elinor\\'s leaving the room,\\n\"Mamma,\" said Marianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject\\nof illness which I cannot conceal from you.  I am sure\\nEdward Ferrars is not well.  We have now been here almost\\na fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but real\\nindisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.\\nWhat else can detain him at Norland?\"\\n\\n\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood.  \"I had none.  On the contrary,\\nif I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has\\nbeen in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\\nof pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,\\nwhen I talked of his coming to Barton.  Does Elinor\\nexpect him already?\"\\n\\n\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course\\nshe must.\"\\n\\n\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I\\nwas talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate\\nfor the spare bedchamber, she observed that there\\nwas no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely\\nthat the room would be wanted for some time.\"\\n\\n\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!\\nBut the whole of their behaviour to each other has been\\nunaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last\\nadieus! How languid their conversation the last evening\\nof their being together! In Edward\\'s farewell there was no\\ndistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes\\nof an affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave\\nthem purposely together in the course of the last morning,\\nand each time did he most unaccountably follow me out\\nof the room.  And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,\\ncried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is invariable.\\nWhen is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try\\nto avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied\\nin it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable\\ncomfort to themselves.  The house and the garden, with all\\nthe objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,\\nand the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland\\nhalf its charms were engaged in again with far greater\\nenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the\\nloss of their father.  Sir John Middleton, who called\\non them every day for the first fortnight, and who was\\nnot in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,\\ncould not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.\\n\\nTheir visitors, except those from Barton Park,\\nwere not many; for, in spite of Sir John\\'s urgent entreaties\\nthat they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated\\nassurances of his carriage being always at their service,\\nthe independence of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s spirit overcame the\\nwish of society for her children; and she was resolute\\nin declining to visit any family beyond the distance\\nof a walk.  There were but few who could be so classed;\\nand it was not all of them that were attainable.\\nAbout a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow\\nwinding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,\\nas formerly described, the girls had, in one of their\\nearliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking\\nmansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,\\ninterested their imagination and made them wish to be\\nbetter acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry,\\nthat its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,\\nwas unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,\\nand never stirred from home.\\n\\nThe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.\\nThe high downs which invited them from almost every window\\nof the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air\\non their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt\\nof the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;\\nand towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret\\none memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\\npartial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear\\nthe confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding\\ndays had occasioned.  The weather was not tempting enough\\nto draw the two others from their pencil and their book,\\nin spite of Marianne\\'s declaration that the day would\\nbe lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would\\nbe drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\\ntogether.\\n\\nThey gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own\\npenetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they\\ncaught in their faces the animating gales of a high\\nsouth-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented\\ntheir mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.\\n\\n\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne,\\n\"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least\\ntwo hours.\"\\n\\nMargaret agreed, and they pursued their way against\\nthe wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about\\ntwenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over\\ntheir heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--\\nChagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,\\nto turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.\\nOne consolation however remained for them, to which the\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;\\nit was that of running with all possible speed down the steep\\nside of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.\\n\\nThey set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage,\\nbut a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;\\nand Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,\\nwas involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom\\nin safety.\\n\\nA gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers\\nplaying round him, was passing up the hill and within\\na few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.\\nHe put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She had\\nraised herself from the ground, but her foot had been\\ntwisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.\\nThe gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her\\nmodesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,\\ntook her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried\\nher down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,\\nthe gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her\\ndirectly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,\\nand quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair\\nin the parlour.\\n\\nElinor and her mother rose up in amazement at\\ntheir entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed\\non him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration\\nwhich equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized\\nfor his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner\\nso frank and so graceful that his person, which was\\nuncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice\\nand expression.  Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,\\nthe gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\\nhave been secured by any act of attention to her child;\\nbut the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,\\ngave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.\\n\\nShe thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness\\nof address which always attended her, invited him to\\nbe seated.  But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.\\nMrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.\\nHis name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present\\nhome was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would\\nallow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire\\nafter Miss Dashwood.  The honour was readily granted,\\nand he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,\\nin the midst of a heavy rain.\\n\\nHis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness\\nwere instantly the theme of general admiration,\\nand the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne\\nreceived particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--\\nMarianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,\\nfor the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his\\nlifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding\\nhim after their entering the house.  But she had seen\\nenough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,\\nand with an energy which always adorned her praise.\\nHis person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever\\ndrawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying\\nher into the house with so little previous formality, there\\nwas a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended\\nthe action to her.  Every circumstance belonging to him\\nwas interesting.  His name was good, his residence was in\\ntheir favourite village, and she soon found out that of all\\nmanly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.\\nHer imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,\\nand the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.\\n\\nSir John called on them as soon as the next interval\\nof fair weather that morning allowed him to get out\\nof doors; and Marianne\\'s accident being related to him,\\nhe was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\\nof the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\\n\\n\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE\\nin the country? That is good news however; I will\\nride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\\n\\n\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here\\nevery year.\"\\n\\n\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\\n\\n\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.\\nA very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider\\nin England.\"\\n\\n\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,\\nindignantly.  \"But what are his manners on more intimate\\nacquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\\n\\nSir John was rather puzzled.\\n\\n\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him\\nas to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,\\nand has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\\nI ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"\\n\\nBut Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\\ncolour of Mr. Willoughby\\'s pointer, than he could\\ndescribe to her the shades of his mind.\\n\\n\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come\\nfrom?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"\\n\\nOn this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;\\nand he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property\\nof his own in the country; that he resided there only\\nwhile he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,\\nto whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\\nto inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth\\ncatching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty\\nlittle estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;\\nand if I were you, I would not give him up to my\\nyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.\\nMiss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.\\nBrandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a\\ngood humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded\\nby the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what\\nyou call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which\\nthey have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us,\\nlet them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however,\\nfrom what you say, that he is a respectable young man,\\nand one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\\n\\n\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,\\nas ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember\\nlast Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced\\nfrom eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\\n\\n\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes,\\n\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\\n\\n\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought\\nto be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them\\nshould know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see\\nhow it will be.  You will be setting your cap at him now,\\nand never think of poor Brandon.\"\\n\\n\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne,\\nwarmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every\\ncommon-place phrase by which wit is intended; and \\'setting\\none\\'s cap at a man,\\' or \\'making a conquest,\\' are the most\\nodious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;\\nand if their construction could ever be deemed clever,\\ntime has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\\n\\nSir John did not much understand this reproof;\\nbut he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,\\n\\n\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,\\none way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,\\nand he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can\\ntell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\\nof ankles.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\n\\nMarianne\\'s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance\\nthan precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage\\nearly the next morning to make his personal enquiries.\\nHe was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;\\nwith a kindness which Sir John\\'s account of him and her own\\ngratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during\\nthe visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,\\nmutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family\\nto whom accident had now introduced him.  Of their\\npersonal charms he had not required a second interview\\nto be convinced.\\n\\nMiss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,\\nregular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.\\nMarianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so\\ncorrect as her sister\\'s, in having the advantage of height,\\nwas more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when\\nin the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,\\ntruth was less violently outraged than usually happens.\\nHer skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,\\nher complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features\\nwere all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;\\nand in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,\\na spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen\\nwithout delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at\\nfirst held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance\\nof his assistance created.  But when this passed away,\\nwhen her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the\\nperfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness\\nand vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond,\\nshe gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\\nlargest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\\nof his stay.\\n\\nIt was only necessary to mention any favourite\\namusement to engage her to talk.  She could not be\\nsilent when such points were introduced, and she\\nhad neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.\\nThey speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\\nand music was mutual, and that it arose from a general\\nconformity of judgment in all that related to either.\\nEncouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\\nshe proceeded to question him on the subject of books;\\nher favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\\nupon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of\\nfive and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to\\nbecome an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,\\nhowever disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly alike.\\nThe same books, the same passages were idolized by each--\\nor if any difference appeared, any objection arose,\\nit lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\\nand the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.\\nHe acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;\\nand long before his visit concluded, they conversed\\nwith the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\\n\\n\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,\\n\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.\\nYou have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby\\'s opinion in\\nalmost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks\\nof Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating\\ntheir beauties as he ought, and you have received every\\nassurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\\nBut how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?\\nYou will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.\\nAnother meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\\non picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then\\nyou can have nothing farther to ask.\"--\\n\\n\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this\\njust? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.\\nI have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.\\nI have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;\\nI have been open and sincere where I ought to have\\nbeen reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had\\nI talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I\\nspoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have\\nbeen spared.\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended\\nwith Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold\\nher myself, if she were capable of wishing to check\\nthe delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--\\nMarianne was softened in a moment.\\n\\nWilloughby, on his side, gave every proof of his\\npleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish\\nof improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.\\nTo enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the\\nencouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\\ngreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it\\nhad ceased to be possible, by Marianne\\'s perfect recovery.\\nShe was confined for some days to the house; but never had\\nany confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young\\nman of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,\\nand open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed\\nto engage Marianne\\'s heart, for with all this, he joined\\nnot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour\\nof mind which was now roused and increased by the example\\nof her own, and which recommended him to her affection\\nbeyond every thing else.\\n\\nHis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.\\nThey read, they talked, they sang together; his musical\\ntalents were considerable; and he read with all the\\nsensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.\\n\\nIn Mrs. Dashwood\\'s estimation he was as faultless\\nas in Marianne\\'s; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him\\nbut a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\\ndelighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on\\nevery occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.\\nIn hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,\\nin sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\\nof undivided attention where his heart was engaged,\\nand in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,\\nhe displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,\\nin spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.\\n\\nMarianne began now to perceive that the desperation\\nwhich had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever\\nseeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,\\nhad been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all\\nthat her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\\nand in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;\\nand his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\\nas earnest, as his abilities were strong.\\n\\nHer mother too, in whose mind not one speculative\\nthought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect\\nof riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and\\nexpect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having\\ngained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s partiality for Marianne, which had\\nso early been discovered by his friends, now first became\\nperceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed\\nby them.  Their attention and wit were drawn off to his\\nmore fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other\\nhad incurred before any partiality arose, was removed\\nwhen his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\\nso justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,\\nthough unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which\\nMrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,\\nwere now actually excited by her sister; and that however\\na general resemblance of disposition between the parties\\nmight forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally\\nstriking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\\nregard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;\\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,\\nwhen opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as\\nshe could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished\\nhim indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity\\nand reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\\nHis manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve\\nappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\\nthan of any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John\\nhad dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,\\nwhich justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,\\nand she regarded him with respect and compassion.\\n\\nPerhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\\nbecause he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,\\nwho, prejudiced against him for being neither lively\\nnor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\\n\\n\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby\\none day, when they were talking of him together,\\n\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;\\nwhom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\\nto talk to.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it\\nis injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed\\nby all the family at the park, and I never see him myself\\nwithout taking pains to converse with him.\"\\n\\n\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby,\\n\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem\\nof the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would\\nsubmit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\\nas Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command\\nthe indifference of any body else?\"\\n\\n\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\\nand Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady\\nMiddleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,\\nyour censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,\\nthan you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\\n\\n\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"\\n\\n\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;\\nand sense will always have attractions for me.\\nYes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.\\nHe has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,\\nhas read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him\\ncapable of giving me much information on various subjects;\\nand he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\\ngood-breeding and good nature.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously,\\n\"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,\\nand the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"\\n\\n\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made\\nany such inquiries, but they happened to be points\\non which I had been previously informed.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may\\nhave extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,\\nand palanquins.\"\\n\\n\"I may venture to say that HIS observations\\nhave stretched much further than your candour.\\nBut why should you dislike him?\"\\n\\n\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,\\nas a very respectable man, who has every body\\'s good word,\\nand nobody\\'s notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\\nmore time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats\\nevery year.\"\\n\\n\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has\\nneither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding\\nhas no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice\\nno expression.\"\\n\\n\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"\\nreplied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your\\nown imagination, that the commendation I am able to give\\nof him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only\\npronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,\\nof gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using\\nme unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,\\nand to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.\\nYou shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have\\nthree unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;\\nhe threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;\\nhe has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,\\nand I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it\\nwill be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,\\nthat I believe his character to be in other respects\\nirreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return\\nfor an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,\\nyou cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\\nas ever.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\n\\nLittle had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined\\nwhen they first came into Devonshire, that so many\\nengagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly\\npresented themselves, or that they should have such frequent\\ninvitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\\nleisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.\\nWhen Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home\\nand abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,\\nwere put into execution.  The private balls at the park\\nthen began; and parties on the water were made and\\naccomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\\nIn every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;\\nand the ease and familiarity which naturally attended\\nthese parties were exactly calculated to give increasing\\nintimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford\\nhim opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,\\nof marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\\nin her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance\\nof her affection.\\n\\nElinor could not be surprised at their attachment.\\nShe only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once\\nor twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some\\nself-command to Marianne.  But Marianne abhorred all\\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;\\nand to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\\nin themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely\\nan unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection\\nof reason to common-place and mistaken notions.\\nWilloughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\\nall times, was an illustration of their opinions.\\n\\nWhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else.\\nEvery thing he did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.\\nIf their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,\\nhe cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get\\nher a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement\\nof the night, they were partners for half the time;\\nand when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,\\nwere careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word\\nto any body else.  Such conduct made them of course\\nmost exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,\\nand seemed hardly to provoke them.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with\\na warmth which left her no inclination for checking this\\nexcessive display of them.  To her it was but the natural\\nconsequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.\\n\\nThis was the season of happiness to Marianne.\\nHer heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment\\nto Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,\\nwas more likely to be softened than she had thought it\\npossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed\\non her present home.\\n\\nElinor\\'s happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not\\nso much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements\\nso pure.  They afforded her no companion that could make\\namends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach\\nher to think of Norland with less regret than ever.\\nNeither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply\\nto her the conversation she missed; although the latter\\nwas an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded\\nher with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\\nher discourse.  She had already repeated her own history\\nto Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor\\'s memory been\\nequal to her means of improvement, she might have known\\nvery early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\\nMr. Jenning\\'s last illness, and what he said to his wife\\na few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more\\nagreeable than her mother only in being more silent.\\nElinor needed little observation to perceive that her\\nreserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\\nhad nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she\\nwas the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore\\nneither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing\\nto say one day that she had not said the day before.\\nHer insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were\\nalways the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\\narranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted\\nin style and her two eldest children attended her,\\nshe never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them\\nthan she might have experienced in sitting at home;--\\nand so little did her presence add to the pleasure\\nof the others, by any share in their conversation,\\nthat they were sometimes only reminded of her being\\namongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\\n\\nIn Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,\\ndid Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the\\nrespect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,\\nor give pleasure as a companion.  Willoughby was out\\nof the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her\\nsisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;\\nhis attentions were wholly Marianne\\'s, and a far less\\nagreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.\\nColonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such\\nencouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing\\nwith Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\nindifference of her sister.\\n\\nElinor\\'s compassion for him increased, as she had reason\\nto suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\\nbeen known to him.  This suspicion was given by some words\\nwhich accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,\\nwhen they were sitting down together by mutual consent,\\nwhile the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed\\non Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,\\nhe said, with a faint smile, \"Your sister, I understand,\\ndoes not approve of second attachments.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\\n\\n\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them\\nimpossible to exist.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it\\nwithout reflecting on the character of her own father,\\nwho had himself two wives, I know not.  A few years\\nhowever will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\\nof common sense and observation; and then they may be\\nmore easy to define and to justify than they now are,\\nby any body but herself.\"\\n\\n\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied;\\n\"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices\\nof a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way\\nto the reception of more general opinions.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.\\n\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings\\nas Marianne\\'s, which all the charms of enthusiasm and\\nignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have\\nall the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;\\nand a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause he resumed the conversation\\nby saying,--\\n\\n\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections\\nagainst a second attachment? or is it equally criminal\\nin every body?  Are those who have been disappointed\\nin their first choice, whether from the inconstancy\\nof its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,\\nto be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae\\nof her principles.  I only know that I never yet heard her\\nadmit any instance of a second attachment\\'s being pardonable.\"\\n\\n\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,\\na total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;\\nfor when the romantic refinements of a young mind\\nare obliged to give way, how frequently are they\\nsucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\\ndangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady\\nwho in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,\\nwho thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced\\nchange--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--\\nHere he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said\\ntoo much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered Elinor\\'s head.\\nThe lady would probably have passed without suspicion,\\nhad he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned\\nher ought not to escape his lips.  As it was,\\nit required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\\nemotion with the tender recollection of past regard.\\nElinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,\\nwould not have done so little.  The whole story would\\nhave been speedily formed under her active imagination;\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order\\nof disastrous love.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\n\\nAs Elinor and Marianne were walking together the\\nnext morning the latter communicated a piece of news\\nto her sister, which in spite of all that she knew\\nbefore of Marianne\\'s imprudence and want of thought,\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.\\nMarianne told her, with the greatest delight, that\\nWilloughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred\\nhimself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering\\nthat it was not in her mother\\'s plan to keep any horse,\\nthat if she were to alter her resolution in favour of\\nthis gift, she must buy another for the servant, and\\nkeep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\\nto receive them, she had accepted the present without\\nhesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.\\n\\n\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire\\nimmediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we\\nwill ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.\\nImagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop\\non some of these downs.\"\\n\\nMost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of\\nfelicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended\\nthe affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.\\nAs to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;\\nMamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse\\nwould do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;\\nas to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.\\nElinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving\\nsuch a present from a man so little, or at least so lately\\nknown to her.  This was too much.\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly,\\n\"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.\\nI have not known him long indeed, but I am much better\\nacquainted with him, than I am with any other creature\\nin the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not\\ntime or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--\\nit is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient\\nto make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others.  I should hold\\nmyself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse\\nfrom my brother, than from Willoughby.  Of John I know\\nvery little, though we have lived together for years;\\nbut of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.\\nShe knew her sister\\'s temper.  Opposition on so tender a\\nsubject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.\\nBut by an appeal to her affection for her mother,\\nby representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be\\nthe case) she consented to this increase of establishment,\\nMarianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to\\ntempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning\\nthe offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,\\nthat it must be declined.\\n\\nShe was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby\\ncalled at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her\\nexpress her disappointment to him in a low voice, on\\nbeing obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.\\nThe reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\\nand they were such as to make further entreaty on his\\nside impossible.  His concern however was very apparent;\\nand after expressing it with earnestness, he added,\\nin the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is\\nstill yours, though you cannot use it now.  I shall keep\\nit only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton\\nto form your own establishment in a more lasting home,\\nQueen Mab shall receive you.\"\\n\\nThis was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the\\nwhole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,\\nand in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone,\\nshe instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning\\nso direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.\\nFrom that moment she doubted not of their being engaged\\nto each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise\\nthan that she, or any of their friends, should be left\\nby tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.\\n\\nMargaret related something to her the next day,\\nwhich placed this matter in a still clearer light.\\nWilloughby had spent the preceding evening with them,\\nand Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\\nwith only him and Marianne, had had opportunity\\nfor observations, which, with a most important face,\\nshe communicated to her eldest sister, when they were\\nnext by themselves.\\n\\n\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to\\ntell you about Marianne.  I am sure she will be married\\nto Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"\\n\\n\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every\\nday since they first met on High-church Down; and they\\nhad not known each other a week, I believe, before you\\nwere certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;\\nbut it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.\"\\n\\n\"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure\\nthey will be married very soon, for he has got a lock\\nof her hair.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair\\nof some great uncle of HIS.\"\\n\\n\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne\\'s. I am almost\\nsure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  Last night\\nafter tea, when you and mama went out of the room,\\nthey were whispering and talking together as fast as\\ncould be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,\\nand presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\\nlock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;\\nand he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;\\nand put it into his pocket-book.\"\\n\\nFor such particulars, stated on such authority,\\nElinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed\\nto it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with\\nwhat she had heard and seen herself.\\n\\nMargaret\\'s sagacity was not always displayed in a\\nway so satisfactory to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings\\nattacked her one evening at the park, to give the name\\nof the young man who was Elinor\\'s particular favourite,\\nwhich had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\\nMargaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,\\n\"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?\"\\n\\nThis of course made every body laugh; and Elinor\\ntried to laugh too.  But the effort was painful.\\nShe was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person\\nwhose name she could not bear with composure to become\\na standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nMarianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did\\nmore harm than good to the cause, by turning very red\\nand saying in an angry manner to Margaret,\\n\\n\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be,\\nyou have no right to repeat them.\"\\n\\n\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret;\\n\"it was you who told me of it yourself.\"\\n\\nThis increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret\\nwas eagerly pressed to say something more.\\n\\n\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings.  \"What is the gentleman\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"I must not tell, ma\\'am. But I know very well what it is;\\nand I know where he is too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house\\nat Norland to be sure.  He is the curate of the parish\\nI dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.\"\\n\\n\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth,\\n\"you know that all this is an invention of your own,\\nand that there is no such person in existence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I\\nam sure there was such a man once, and his name begins\\nwith an F.\"\\n\\nMost grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton\\nfor observing, at this moment, \"that it rained very hard,\"\\nthough she believed the interruption to proceed less from\\nany attention to her, than from her ladyship\\'s great dislike\\nof all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\\nher husband and mother.  The idea however started by her,\\nwas immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was\\non every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;\\nand much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.\\nWilloughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne\\nto sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours\\nof different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.\\nBut not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into\\nwhich it had thrown her.\\n\\nA party was formed this evening for going on the\\nfollowing day to see a very fine place about twelve miles\\nfrom Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon,\\nwithout whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor,\\nwho was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.\\nThe grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\\nand Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,\\nmight be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had\\nformed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer\\nfor the last ten years.  They contained a noble piece\\nof water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of\\nthe morning\\'s amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,\\nopen carriages only to be employed, and every thing\\nconducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\\n\\nTo some few of the company it appeared rather\\na bold undertaking, considering the time of year,\\nand that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--\\nand Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded\\nby Elinor to stay at home.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\n\\nTheir intended excursion to Whitwell turned out\\nvery different from what Elinor had expected.  She was\\nprepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened;\\nbut the event was still more unfortunate, for they did\\nnot go at all.\\n\\nBy ten o\\'clock the whole party was assembled at\\nthe park, where they were to breakfast.  The morning\\nwas rather favourable, though it had rained all night,\\nas the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\\nand the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high\\nspirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined\\nto submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships\\nrather than be otherwise.\\n\\nWhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.\\nAmong the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he\\ntook it, looked at the direction, changed colour,\\nand immediately left the room.\\n\\n\"What is the matter with Brandon?\" said Sir John.\\n\\nNobody could tell.\\n\\n\"I hope he has had no bad news,\" said Lady Middleton.\\n\"It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel\\nBrandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly.\"\\n\\nIn about five minutes he returned.\\n\\n\"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nas soon as he entered the room.\\n\\n\"None at all, ma\\'am, I thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say\\nthat your sister is worse.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am. It came from town, and is merely\\na letter of business.\"\\n\\n\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much,\\nif it was only a letter of business?  Come, come,\\nthis won\\'t do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.\"\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" said Lady Middleton, \"recollect what\\nyou are saying.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny\\nis married?\" said Mrs. Jennings, without attending\\nto her daughter\\'s reproof.\\n\\n\"No, indeed, it is not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I\\nhope she is well.\"\\n\\n\"Whom do you mean, ma\\'am?\" said he, colouring a little.\\n\\n\"Oh! you know who I mean.\"\\n\\n\"I am particularly sorry, ma\\'am,\" said he,\\naddressing Lady Middleton, \"that I should receive this\\nletter today, for it is on business which requires\\nmy immediate attendance in town.\"\\n\\n\"In town!\" cried Mrs. Jennings.  \"What can you\\nhave to do in town at this time of year?\"\\n\\n\"My own loss is great,\" be continued, \"in being obliged\\nto leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned,\\nas I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance\\nat Whitwell.\"\\n\\nWhat a blow upon them all was this!\\n\\n\"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,\"\\nsaid Marianne, eagerly, \"will it not be sufficient?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\"We must go,\" said Sir John.--\"It shall not be put\\noff when we are so near it.  You cannot go to town till\\ntomorrow, Brandon, that is all.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it\\nis not in my power to delay my journey for one day!\"\\n\\n\"If you would but let us know what your business is,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings, \"we might see whether it could be put\\noff or not.\"\\n\\n\"You would not be six hours later,\" said Willoughby,\\n\"if you were to defer your journey till our return.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.\"--\\n\\nElinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne,\\n\"There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.\\nBrandon is one of them.  He was afraid of catching cold\\nI dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it.\\nI would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" replied Marianne.\\n\\n\"There is no persuading you to change your mind,\\nBrandon, I know of old,\" said Sir John, \"when once you\\nare determined on anything.  But, however, I hope you\\nwill think better of it.  Consider, here are the two Miss\\nCareys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods\\nwalked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up\\ntwo hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\"\\n\\nColonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being\\nthe cause of disappointing the party; but at the same\\ntime declared it to be unavoidable.\\n\\n\"Well, then, when will you come back again?\"\\n\\n\"I hope we shall see you at Barton,\" added her ladyship,\\n\"as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must\\nput off the party to Whitwell till you return.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain,\\nwhen I may have it in my power to return, that I dare\\nnot engage for it at all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! he must and shall come back,\" cried Sir John.\\n\"If he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go\\nafter him.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, so do, Sir John,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"and then\\nperhaps you may find out what his business is.\"\\n\\n\"I do not want to pry into other men\\'s concerns.\\nI suppose it is something he is ashamed of.\"\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s horses were announced.\\n\\n\"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?\"\\nadded Sir John.\\n\\n\"No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you\\na good journey.  But you had better change your mind.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you it is not in my power.\"\\n\\nHe then took leave of the whole party.\\n\\n\"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters\\nin town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid, none at all.\"\\n\\n\"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time\\nthan I should wish to do.\"\\n\\nTo Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Come Colonel,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"before you go,\\ndo let us know what you are going about.\"\\n\\nHe wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John,\\nleft the room.\\n\\nThe complaints and lamentations which politeness\\nhad hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally;\\nand they all agreed again and again how provoking it was\\nto be so disappointed.\\n\\n\"I can guess what his business is, however,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings exultingly.\\n\\n\"Can you, ma\\'am?\" said almost every body.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"And who is Miss Williams?\" asked Marianne.\\n\\n\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am\\nsure you must have heard of her before.  She is a relation\\nof the Colonel\\'s, my dear; a very near relation.  We will\\nnot say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.\"\\nThen, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\\n\"She is his natural daughter.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.\\nI dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune.\"\\n\\nWhen Sir John returned, he joined most heartily\\nin the general regret on so unfortunate an event;\\nconcluding however by observing, that as they were\\nall got together, they must do something by way of\\nbeing happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,\\nthat although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell,\\nthey might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\\nabout the country.  The carriages were then ordered;\\nWilloughby\\'s was first, and Marianne never looked\\nhappier than when she got into it.  He drove through\\nthe park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;\\nand nothing more of them was seen till their return,\\nwhich did not happen till after the return of all the rest.\\nThey both seemed delighted with their drive; but said\\nonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,\\nwhile the others went on the downs.\\n\\nIt was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,\\nand that every body should be extremely merry all day long.\\nSome more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the\\npleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir\\nJohn observed with great contentment.  Willoughby took\\nhis usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\\nMrs. Jennings sat on Elinor\\'s right hand; and they had not\\nbeen long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby,\\nand said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,\\n\"I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.\\nI know where you spent the morning.\"\\n\\nMarianne coloured, and replied very hastily,\\n\"Where, pray?\"--\\n\\n\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had\\nbeen out in my curricle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well,\\nand I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.--\\nI hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.  It is a very\\nlarge one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you\\nwill have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much\\nwhen I was there six years ago.\"\\n\\nMarianne turned away in great confusion.\\nMrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her\\nresolution to know where they had been, she had actually\\nmade her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby\\'s groom;\\nand that she had by that method been informed that they\\nhad gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there\\nin walking about the garden and going all over the house.\\n\\nElinor could hardly believe this to be true,\\nas it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,\\nor Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was\\nin it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.\\n\\nAs soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired\\nof her about it; and great was her surprise when she\\nfound that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings\\nwas perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry with her\\nfor doubting it.\\n\\n\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not\\ngo there, or that we did not see the house?  Is not it\\nwhat you have often wished to do yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith\\nwas there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can\\nhave a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open\\ncarriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.\\nI never spent a pleasanter morning in my life.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness\\nof an employment does not always evince its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof\\nof it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety\\nin what I did, I should have been sensible of it at\\nthe time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,\\nand with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you\\nto some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin\\nto doubt the discretion of your own conduct?\"\\n\\n\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are\\nto be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all\\noffending every moment of our lives.  I value not her\\ncensure any more than I should do her commendation.\\nI am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\\nover Mrs. Smith\\'s grounds, or in seeing her house.\\nThey will one day be Mr. Willoughby\\'s, and--\"\\n\\n\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,\\nyou would not be justified in what you have done.\"\\n\\nShe blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly\\ngratifying to her; and after a ten minutes\\' interval of\\nearnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said\\nwith great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather\\nill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted\\nparticularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,\\nI assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room\\nup stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,\\nand with modern furniture it would be delightful.\\nIt is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.\\nOn one side you look across the bowling-green, behind\\nthe house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you\\nhave a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,\\nof those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.\\nI did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be\\nmore forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly\\nfitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,\\nwould make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms\\nin England.\"\\n\\nCould Elinor have listened to her without interruption\\nfrom the others, she would have described every room\\nin the house with equal delight.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\n\\nThe sudden termination of Colonel Brandon\\'s visit\\nat the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,\\nfilled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings\\nfor two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every\\none must be who takes a very lively interest in all the\\ncomings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered,\\nwith little intermission what could be the reason of it;\\nwas sure there must be some bad news, and thought over\\nevery kind of distress that could have befallen him,\\nwith a fixed determination that he should not escape\\nthem all.\\n\\n\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,\\nI am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face.\\nPoor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.\\nThe estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\\na year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.\\nI do think he must have been sent for about money matters,\\nfor what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.\\nI would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it\\nis about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,\\nbecause he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\\nMay be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,\\nfor I have a notion she is always rather sickly.\\nI would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.\\nIt is not so very likely he should be distressed in\\nhis circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,\\nand to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.\\nI wonder what it can be!  May be his sister is worse\\nat Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off\\nin such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out\\nof all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into\\nthe bargain.\"\\n\\nSo wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion\\nvarying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming\\nequally probable as they arose.  Elinor, though she felt\\nreally interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,\\ncould not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\naway, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;\\nfor besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\\njustify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,\\nher wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was engrossed\\nby the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby\\non the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly\\ninteresting to them all.  As this silence continued,\\nevery day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\\nwith the disposition of both.  Why they should not openly\\nacknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\\nbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place,\\nElinor could not imagine.\\n\\nShe could easily conceive that marriage might not\\nbe immediately in their power; for though Willoughby\\nwas independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.\\nHis estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven\\nhundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income\\ncould hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\\nof his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy\\nmaintained by them relative to their engagement, which\\nin fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;\\nand it was so wholly contradictory to their general\\nopinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\\nher mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt\\nwas enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\\n\\nNothing could be more expressive of attachment\\nto them all, than Willoughby\\'s behaviour.  To Marianne\\nit had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover\\'s\\nheart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the\\naffectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The cottage\\nseemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;\\nmany more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;\\nand if no general engagement collected them at the park,\\nthe exercise which called him out in the morning was\\nalmost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day\\nwas spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet.\\n\\nOne evening in particular, about a week after\\nColonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed\\nmore than usually open to every feeling of attachment\\nto the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood\\'s\\nhappening to mention her design of improving the cottage\\nin the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration\\nof a place which affection had established as perfect with him.\\n\\n\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!\\nNo. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must\\nbe added to its walls, not an inch to its size,\\nif my feelings are regarded.\"\\n\\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood,\\n\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother\\nwill never have money enough to attempt it.\"\\n\\n\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"May she\\nalways be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I\\nwould not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\\nof yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements\\nin the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed\\nsum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,\\nI would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\\nof it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really\\nso attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he.  \"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,\\nI consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\\nis attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull\\nCombe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this\\ncottage.\"\\n\\n\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,\\nI suppose,\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all\\nand every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience\\nor INconvenience about it, should the least variation\\nbe perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I\\nmight perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"\\n\\n\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under\\nthe disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,\\nyou will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\\nnow do this.\"\\n\\n\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby,\\n\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will\\nalways have one claim of my affection, which no other can\\npossibly share.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,\\nwhose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,\\nas plainly denoted how well she understood him.\\n\\n\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at\\nAllenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were\\ninhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring\\nits situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.\\nHow little did I then think that the very first news\\nI should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into\\nthe country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I\\nfelt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,\\nwhich nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I\\nshould experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have\\nbeen so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.\\nThen continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this\\nhouse you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it\\nof its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear\\nparlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which\\nso many happy hours have been since spent by us together,\\nyou would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room\\nwhich has hitherto contained within itself more real\\naccommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\\nthe handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration\\nof the kind should be attempted.\\n\\n\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.\\n\"Your promise makes me easy.  Extend it a little farther,\\nand it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your\\nhouse will remain the same, but that I shall ever find\\nyou and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you\\nwill always consider me with the kindness which has made\\neverything belonging to you so dear to me.\"\\n\\nThe promise was readily given, and Willoughby\\'s\\nbehaviour during the whole of the evening declared\\nat once his affection and happiness.\\n\\n\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\\nwhen he was leaving them.  \"I do not ask you to come in\\nthe morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady\\nMiddleton.\"\\n\\nHe engaged to be with them by four o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood\\'s visit to Lady Middleton took place\\nthe next day, and two of her daughters went with her;\\nbut Marianne excused herself from being of the party,\\nunder some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,\\nwho concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby\\nthe night before of calling on her while they were absent,\\nwas perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.\\n\\nOn their return from the park they found Willoughby\\'s\\ncurricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,\\nand Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture\\nhad been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;\\nbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\\nhad taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in the\\npassage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour\\napparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief\\nat her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\\nSurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\\nshe had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,\\nwho was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back\\ntowards them.  He turned round on their coming in,\\nand his countenance shewed that he strongly partook\\nof the emotion which over-powered Marianne.\\n\\n\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood\\nas she entered--\"is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;\\nand with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may\\nrather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a\\nvery heavy disappointment!\"\\n\\n\"Disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.\\nMrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege\\nof riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on\\nbusiness to London.  I have just received my dispatches,\\nand taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration\\nI am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\\n\\n\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Almost this moment.\"\\n\\n\"This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must\\nbe obliged;--and her business will not detain you from\\nus long I hope.\"\\n\\nHe coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I\\nhave no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.\\nMy visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within\\nthe twelvemonth.\"\\n\\n\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only\\nhouse in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?\\nFor shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"\\n\\nHis colour increased; and with his eyes fixed\\non the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.\\nElinor felt equal amazement.  For a few moments every one\\nwas silent.  Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.\\n\\n\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at\\nBarton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not\\npress you to return here immediately, because you only\\ncan judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;\\nand on this head I shall be no more disposed to question\\nyour judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\\n\\n\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby,\\nconfusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter\\nmyself\"--\\n\\nHe stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished\\nto speak, and another pause succeeded.  This was broken\\nby Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly\\nto linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself\\nany longer by remaining among friends whose society\\nit is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\\n\\nHe then hastily took leave of them all and left\\nthe room.  They saw him step into his carriage,\\nand in a minute it was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly\\nquitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\\nand alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.\\n\\nElinor\\'s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother\\'s.\\nShe thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.\\nWilloughby\\'s behaviour in taking leave of them, his\\nembarrassment,\\nand affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his\\nunwillingness\\nto accept her mother\\'s invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\\nlover,\\nso unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared\\nthat no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the\\nnext that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\\nand\\nher sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room\\nwas such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,\\nthough when she considered what Marianne\\'s love for him was,\\na quarrel seemed almost impossible.\\n\\nBut whatever might be the particulars of their separation,\\nher sister\\'s affliction was indubitable; and she thought\\nwith the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\\nwhich Marianne was in all probability not merely giving\\nway to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.\\n\\nIn about half an hour her mother returned, and though\\nher eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\\n\\n\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\"\\nsaid she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart\\ndoes he travel?\"\\n\\n\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It\\nseems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was\\nwith us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now,\\nafter only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending\\nto return!--Something more than what be owned to us must\\nhave happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave\\nlike himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.\\nWhat can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he\\nhave shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--\\n\\n\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could\\nplainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.\\nI have thought it all over I assure you, and I can\\nperfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\\nstrange to me as well as to you.\"\\n\\n\"Can you, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most\\nsatisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt\\nwhere you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you\\nshall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded\\nthat Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\\ndisapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views\\nfor him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--\\nand that the business which she sends him off to transact\\nis invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I\\nbelieve to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she\\nDOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore\\nat present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,\\nand he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,\\nto give into her schemes, and absent himself from\\nDevonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,\\nthat this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen\\nto no cavil, unless you can point out any other method\\nof understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.\\nAnd now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not\\nhave happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your\\nfeelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.\\nYou had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt\\nfor poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.\\nYou are resolved to think him blameable, because he took\\nleave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\\nhas shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,\\nor for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are\\nno probabilities to be accepted, merely because they\\nare not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we\\nhave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world\\nto think ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable\\nin themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,\\nafter all, what is it you suspect him of?\"\\n\\n\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of\\nsomething unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\\nof such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.\\nThere is great truth, however, in what you have now urged\\nof the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it\\nis my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.\\nWilloughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\\nreasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\\nBut it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge\\nthem at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I\\ncannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"\\n\\n\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from\\nhis character, where the deviation is necessary.\\nBut you really do admit the justice of what I have said\\nin his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\\n\\n\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their\\nengagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--\\nand if that is the case, it must be highly expedient\\nfor Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.\\nBut this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\\n\\n\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse\\nWilloughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange\\nindeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day\\nfor incautiousness.\"\\n\\n\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor;\\n\"but of their engagement I do.\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"\\n\\n\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the\\nsubject, by either of them.\"\\n\\n\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have\\nspoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne\\nand to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,\\ndeclared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,\\nand that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\\nrelation?  Have we not perfectly understood each other?\\nHas not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,\\nhis attentive and affectionate respect?  My Elinor,\\nis it possible to doubt their engagement?  How could\\nsuch a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed\\nthat Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your\\nsister\\'s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps\\nfor months, without telling her of his affection;--that\\nthey should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"\\n\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance\\nexcept ONE is in favour of their engagement;\\nbut that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,\\nand with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\\n\\n\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed\\nof Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,\\nyou can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.\\nHas he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\\nall this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"\\n\\n\"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\n\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can\\nleave her with such indifference, such carelessness\\nof the future, as you attribute to him.\"\\n\\n\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never\\nconsidered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,\\nI confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they\\nmay soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond,\\nevery fear of mine will be removed.\"\\n\\n\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see\\nthem at the altar, you would suppose they were going to\\nbe married.  Ungracious girl!  But I require no such proof.\\nNothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;\\nno secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open\\nand unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister\\'s wishes.\\nIt must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?\\nIs he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any\\ninconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor.\\n\"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his\\nintegrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.\\nIt has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.\\nI was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,\\nand did not return your kindness with any cordiality.\\nBut all this may be explained by such a situation of his\\naffairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted from\\nmy sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;\\nand if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,\\nto resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet\\naware that by declining your invitation, by saying\\nthat he was going away for some time, he should seem\\nto act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,\\nbe might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,\\na plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\\nmore to his honour I think, as well as more consistent\\nwith his general character;--but I will not raise objections\\nagainst any one\\'s conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\\nas a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from\\nwhat I may think right and consistent.\"\\n\\n\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does\\nnot deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known\\nhim long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;\\nand who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  Had he been\\nin a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without\\nacknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.\\nIt is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,\\nfor their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;\\nand even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now\\nbe very advisable.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret;\\nand Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations\\nof her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,\\nand hope for the justice of all.\\n\\nThey saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,\\nwhen she entered the room and took her place at the table\\nwithout saying a word.  Her eyes were red and swollen;\\nand it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained\\nwith difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,\\ncould neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her\\nmother\\'s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,\\nher small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst\\ninto tears and left the room.\\n\\nThis violent oppression of spirits continued the\\nwhole evening.  She was without any power, because she\\nwas without any desire of command over herself.\\nThe slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant; and though her family\\nwere most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was\\nimpossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear\\nof every subject which her feelings connected with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\n\\nMarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable\\nhad she been able to sleep at all the first night\\nafter parting from Willoughby.  She would have been\\nashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,\\nhad she not risen from her bed in more need of repose\\nthan when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which\\nmade such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger\\nof incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she\\nwept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,\\nwas unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,\\nand forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.\\nHer sensibility was potent enough!\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself,\\nand wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the\\nrecollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present\\nreverse for the chief of the morning.\\n\\nThe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.\\nShe played over every favourite song that she had been used\\nto play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices\\nhad been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing\\non every line of music that he had written out for her,\\ntill her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\\ncould be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every\\nday applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte\\nalternately singing and crying; her voice often totally\\nsuspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music,\\nshe courted the misery which a contrast between the past\\nand present was certain of giving.  She read nothing\\nbut what they had been used to read together.\\n\\nSuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported\\nfor ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;\\nbut these employments, to which she daily recurred,\\nher solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced\\noccasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.\\n\\nNo letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected\\nby Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again\\nbecame uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations\\nwhenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.\\n\\n\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John\\nfetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them\\nto it.  We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,\\nand we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if\\ntheir correspondence were to pass through Sir John\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nElinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried\\nto find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.\\nBut there was one method so direct, so simple, and in\\nher opinion so eligible of knowing the real state\\nof the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,\\nthat she could not help suggesting it to her mother.\\n\\n\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she,\\n\"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you,\\nher mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question\\ncould not give offence.  It would be the natural result\\nof your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve,\\nand to you more especially.\"\\n\\n\"I would not ask such a question for the world.\\nSupposing it possible that they are not engaged,\\nwhat distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any\\nrate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve\\nher confidence again, after forcing from her a confession\\nof what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.\\nI know Marianne\\'s heart: I know that she dearly loves me,\\nand that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\\nknown,\\nwhen circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.\\nI would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;\\nof a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent\\nthe denial which her wishes might direct.\"\\n\\nElinor thought this generosity overstrained,\\nconsidering her sister\\'s youth, and urged the matter farther,\\nbut in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,\\nwere all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s romantic delicacy.\\n\\nIt was several days before Willoughby\\'s name\\nwas mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;\\nSir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;\\ntheir witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--\\nbut one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a\\nvolume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,\\n\\n\"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear\\nWilloughby went away before we could get through it.\\nWe will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may\\nbe months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"\\n\\n\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.\\n\"No--nor many weeks.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;\\nbut it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply\\nfrom Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby\\nand knowledge of his intentions.\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after his leaving the country,\\nMarianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\\nusual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.\\nHitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\\nher rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked\\nof the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,\\nand could never be found when the others set off.\\nBut at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,\\nwho greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  They walked\\nalong the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\\nfor Marianne\\'s MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,\\nsatisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.\\nBeyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,\\nthough still rich, was less wild and more open, a long\\nstretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\\nto Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\\nthey stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage,\\nfrom a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\\nof their walks before.\\n\\nAmongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered\\nan animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.\\nIn a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;\\nand in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,\\n\\n\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was\\nhastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,\\n\\n\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is\\nnot Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,\\nand has not his air.\"\\n\\n\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.\\nHis air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"\\n\\nShe walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,\\nto screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost\\ncertain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her\\npace and kept up with her.  They were soon within\\nthirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again;\\nher heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,\\nshe was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters\\nwere raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known\\nas Willoughby\\'s, joined them in begging her to stop,\\nand she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\nEdward Ferrars.\\n\\nHe was the only person in the world who could\\nat that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;\\nthe only one who could have gained a smile from her;\\nbut she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her\\nsister\\'s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\\n\\nHe dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,\\nwalked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely\\ncoming to visit them.\\n\\nHe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,\\nbut especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of\\nregard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.\\nTo Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister\\nwas but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\\nhad often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.\\nOn Edward\\'s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.\\nHe was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\\nin seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,\\nsaid little but what was forced from him by questions,\\nand distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.\\nMarianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.\\nShe began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,\\nas every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her\\nthoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast\\nsufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\\n\\nAfter a short silence which succeeded the first\\nsurprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked\\nEdward if he came directly from London.  No, he had\\nbeen in Devonshire a fortnight.\\n\\n\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being\\nso long in the same county with Elinor without seeing\\nher before.\\n\\nHe looked rather distressed as he added, that he\\nhad been staying with some friends near Plymouth.\\n\\n\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks\\nmuch as it always does at this time of the year.\\nThe woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation\\nhave I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted,\\nas I walked, to see them driven in showers about me\\nby the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air\\naltogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.\\nThey are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,\\nand driven as much as possible from the sight.\"\\n\\n\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your\\npassion for dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often\\nunderstood.  But SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this,\\nshe sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing\\nherself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she, calling his attention\\nto the prospect, \"here is Barton valley.  Look up to it,\\nand be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!\\nDid you ever see their equals?  To the left is Barton park,\\namongst those woods and plantations.  You may see the end\\nof the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill,\\nwhich rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\\n\\n\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these\\nbottoms must be dirty in winter.\"\\n\\n\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the\\nobjects before me, I see a very dirty lane.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\\n\\n\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the\\nMiddletons pleasant people?\"\\n\\n\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not\\nbe more unfortunately situated.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can\\nyou be so unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr.\\nFerrars;\\nand towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you\\nforgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many\\npainful moments.\"\\n\\nElinor took no notice of this; and directing\\nher attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support\\nsomething like discourse with him, by talking of their\\npresent residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him\\noccasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;\\nbut resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\\nrather than the present, she avoided every appearance\\nof resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she\\nthought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at\\nseeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,\\nof all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression\\nof regard long outlived her wonder.  He received the kindest\\nwelcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him\\nbefore he entered the house, and they were quite overcome\\nby the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man\\ncould not very well be in love with either of her daughters,\\nwithout extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the\\nsatisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.\\nHis affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,\\nand his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.\\nHe was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,\\nadmired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still\\nhe was not in spirits.  The whole family perceived it,\\nand Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality\\nin his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents.\\n\\n\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\"\\nsaid she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round\\nthe fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have\\nno more talents than inclination for a public life!\"\\n\\n\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you\\nmust be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination\\nfor expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,\\nand no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be\\ndistinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.\\nThank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.\"\\n\\n\"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes\\nare all moderate.\"\\n\\n\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world,\\nI believe.  I wish as well as every body else to be\\nperfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be\\nin my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"\\n\\n\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.  \"What have\\nwealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"\\n\\n\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth\\nhas much to do with it.\"\\n\\n\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only\\ngive happiness where there is nothing else to give it.\\nBeyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,\\nas far as mere self is concerned.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come\\nto the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth\\nare very much alike, I dare say; and without them,\\nas the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas\\nare only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"\\n\\n\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;\\nnot more than THAT.\"\\n\\nElinor laughed.  \"TWO thousand a year! ONE is my\\nwealth! I guessed how it would end.\"\\n\\n\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\"\\nsaid Marianne.  \"A family cannot well be maintained on\\na smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.\\nA proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,\\nand hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"\\n\\nElinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing\\nso accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.\\n\\n\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have\\nhunters?  Every body does not hunt.\"\\n\\nMarianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought,\\n\"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"\\n\\n\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes\\nsparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing\\nwith the delight of such imaginary happiness.\\n\\n\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be!\\nI wonder what I should do with it!\"\\n\\nMarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\\n\\n\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich\\nmy help.\"\\n\\n\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\"\\nobserved Elinor, \"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\\n\\n\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family\\nto London,\" said Edward, \"in such an event!  What a happy\\nday for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  You,\\nMiss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every\\nnew print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,\\nI know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough\\nin London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\\nScott--she would buy them all over and over again: she\\nwould buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their\\nfalling into unworthy hands; and she would have every\\nbook that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\\nShould not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very saucy.\\nBut I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our\\nold disputes.\"\\n\\n\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it\\nbe melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you\\nwill never offend me by talking of former times.\\nYou are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly\\nbe employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\\n\\n\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\\nin annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"\\n\\n\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do\\nwith it.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that\\nperson who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,\\nthat no one can ever be in love more than once in their\\nlife--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.\\nIt is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to\\nchange them.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor,\\n\"she is not at all altered.\"\\n\\n\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me.\\nYou are not very gay yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.\\n\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"\\n\\n\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne\\'s,\" said Elinor;\\n\"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,\\nvery eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal\\nand always with animation--but she is not often really merry.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I\\nhave always set her down as a lively girl.\"\\n\\n\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some\\npoint or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,\\nor ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can\\nhardly tell why or in what the deception originated.\\nSometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,\\nand very frequently by what other people say of them,\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\\n\\n\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne,\\n\"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.\\nI thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\\nto those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\n\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed\\nat the subjection of the understanding.  All I have\\never attempted to influence has been the behaviour.\\nYou must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\\nin general with greater attention; but when have I advised\\nyou to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\\njudgment in serious matters?\"\\n\\n\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your\\nplan of general civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain\\nno ground?\"\\n\\n\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor,\\nlooking expressively at Marianne.\\n\\n\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side\\nof the question; but I am afraid my practice is much\\nmore on your sister\\'s.  I never wish to offend, but I\\nam so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,\\nwhen I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.\\nI have frequently thought that I must have been intended\\nby nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at\\nmy ease among strangers of gentility!\"\\n\\n\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention\\nof hers,\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\"\\nreplied Edward.  \"Shyness is only the effect of a sense\\nof inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade\\nmyself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,\\nI should not be shy.\"\\n\\n\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne,\\n\"and that is worse.\"\\n\\nEdward started--\"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring.\\n\"Reserved!--how, in what manner?  What am I to tell you?\\nWhat can you suppose?\"\\n\\nElinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying\\nto laugh off the subject, she said to him, \"Do not you\\nknow my sister well enough to understand what she means?\\nDo not you know she calls every one reserved who does not\\ntalk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously\\nas herself?\"\\n\\nEdward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness\\nreturned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat\\nfor some time silent and dull.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\n\\nElinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits\\nof her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very\\npartial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it\\nappeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;\\nshe wished it were equally evident that he still\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once\\nshe had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the\\ncontinuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;\\nand the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\\none moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding\\none.\\n\\nHe joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room\\nthe next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,\\nwho was always eager to promote their happiness as far\\nas she could, soon left them to themselves.  But before she\\nwas half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,\\nturning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.\\n\\n\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\"\\nsaid be, \"as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall\\nbe back again presently.\"\\n\\n                    ***\\n\\nEdward returned to them with fresh admiration\\nof the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,\\nhe had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;\\nand the village itself, in a much higher situation than\\nthe cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\\nexceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured\\nMarianne\\'s attention, and she was beginning to describe\\nher own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more\\nminutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,\\nwhen Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not\\nenquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge\\nin the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call\\nhills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange\\nand uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;\\nand distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\\nYou must be satisfied with such admiration as I can\\nhonestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the\\nhills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\\nand the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\\nand there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,\\nbecause it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it\\nis a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can\\neasily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,\\ngrey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\\nI know nothing of the picturesque.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne;\\n\"but why should you boast of it?\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind\\nof affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he\\nbelieves many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\\nof nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with\\nsuch pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less\\ndiscrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.\\nHe is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration\\nof landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.\\nEvery body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\\nthe taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,\\nand sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,\\nbecause I could find no language to describe them\\nin but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"\\n\\n\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel\\nall the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\\nto feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me\\nto feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,\\nbut not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,\\ntwisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they\\nare tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,\\ntattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,\\nor heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug\\nfarm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,\\nhappy villages please me better than the finest banditti\\nin the world.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked with amazement at Edward,\\nwith compassion at her sister.  Elinor only laughed.\\n\\nThe subject was continued no farther; and Marianne\\nremained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly\\nengaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and\\nin taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed\\nso directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\\nof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\\n\\n\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried.\\n\"Is that Fanny\\'s hair? I remember her promising to give\\nyou some.  But I should have thought her hair had been darker.\"\\n\\nMarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--\\nbut when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own\\nvexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\\nby his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary\\nglance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister\\'s hair.\\nThe setting always casts a different shade on it,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nElinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.\\nThat the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as\\nwell satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their\\nconclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free\\ngift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been\\nprocured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\\nShe was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,\\nand affecting to take no notice of what passed,\\nby instantly talking of something else, she internally\\nresolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\\nthe hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,\\nthat it was exactly the shade of her own.\\n\\nEdward\\'s embarrassment lasted some time, and it\\nended in an absence of mind still more settled.\\nHe was particularly grave the whole morning.\\nMarianne severely censured herself for what she had said;\\nbut her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,\\nhad she known how little offence it had given her sister.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir\\nJohn and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival\\nof a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey\\nof the guest.  With the assistance of his mother-in-law,\\nSir John was not long in discovering that the name of\\nFerrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine\\nof raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but\\nthe newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have\\nprevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,\\nshe only learned, from some very significant looks, how far\\ntheir penetration, founded on Margaret\\'s instructions, extended.\\n\\nSir John never came to the Dashwoods without either\\ninviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink\\ntea with them that evening.  On the present occasion,\\nfor the better entertainment of their visitor, towards\\nwhose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,\\nhe wished to engage them for both.\\n\\n\"You MUST drink tea with us to night,\" said he,\\n\"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must\\nabsolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  \"And who knows\\nbut you may raise a dance,\" said she.  \"And that will\\ntempt YOU, Miss Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"A dance!\" cried Marianne.  \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"\\n\\n\"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers\\nto be sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance\\nbecause a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!\"\\n\\n\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John,\\n\"that Willoughby were among us again.\"\\n\\nThis, and Marianne\\'s blushing, gave new suspicions\\nto Edward.  \"And who is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice,\\nto Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.\\n\\nShe gave him a brief reply.  Marianne\\'s countenance\\nwas more communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend,\\nnot only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne\\'s\\nexpressions as had puzzled him before; and when their\\nvisitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,\\nin a whisper, \"I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you\\nmy guess?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"\\n\\nMarianne was surprised and confused, yet she could\\nnot help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,\\nand after a moment\\'s silence, said,\\n\\n\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come\\nI hope...I am sure you will like him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished\\nat her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it\\nto be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,\\nfounded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby\\nand herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\n\\nEdward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly\\npressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he\\nwere bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved\\nto be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\\nthe height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,\\nthough still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew\\nmore and more partial to the house and environs--never\\nspoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time\\nto be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he\\nshould go when he left them--but still, go he must.\\nNever had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly\\nbelieve it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other things\\nhe said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave\\nthe lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland;\\nhe detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,\\nhe must go.  He valued their kindness beyond any thing,\\nand his greatest happiness was in being with them.\\nYet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite\\nof their wishes and his own, and without any restraint\\non his time.\\n\\nElinor placed all that was astonishing in this\\nway of acting to his mother\\'s account; and it was\\nhappy for her that he had a mother whose character\\nwas so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general\\nexcuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.\\nDisappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes\\ndispleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,\\nshe was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\\nwith all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\\nwhich had been rather more painfully extorted from her,\\nfor Willoughby\\'s service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,\\nof openness, and of consistency, were most usually\\nattributed to his want of independence, and his better\\nknowledge of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s disposition and designs.\\nThe shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\\nin leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,\\nthe same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.\\nThe old well-established grievance of duty against will,\\nparent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have\\nbeen glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,\\nthis opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would\\nbe reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.\\nBut from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\\nto the renewal of her confidence in Edward\\'s affection,\\nto the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\\nwhich fell from him while at Barton, and above all\\nto that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\\nround his finger.\\n\\n\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were\\nat breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man\\nif you had any profession to engage your time and give\\nan interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience\\nto your friends, indeed, might result from it--you\\nwould not be able to give them so much of your time.\\nBut (with a smile) you would be materially benefited\\nin one particular at least--you would know where to go\\nwhen you left them.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long\\nthought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,\\nand is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\\nto me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,\\nno profession to give me employment, or afford me any\\nthing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety,\\nand the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,\\nan idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our\\nchoice of a profession.  I always preferred the church,\\nas I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.\\nThey recommended the army.  That was a great deal\\ntoo smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel\\nenough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,\\nmade a very good appearance in the first circles,\\nand drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had\\nno inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse\\nstudy of it, which my family approved.  As for the navy,\\nit had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\\nsubject was first started to enter it--and, at length,\\nas there was no necessity for my having any profession\\nat all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without\\na red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced\\non the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,\\nand a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\\nfriends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford\\nand have been properly idle ever since.\"\\n\\n\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted\\nyour own happiness, that your sons will be brought up\\nto as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\\nas Columella\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,\\n\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling,\\nin action, in condition, in every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate\\nwant of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,\\nand fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.\\nBut remember that the pain of parting from friends\\nwill be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\\neducation or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want\\nnothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,\\ncall it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time,\\nthat independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,\\nand it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\\nprevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\\nHow much may not a few months do?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many\\nmonths to produce any good to me.\"\\n\\nThis desponding turn of mind, though it could not\\nbe communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain\\nto them all in the parting, which shortly took place,\\nand left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor\\'s\\nfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time\\nto subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,\\nand to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\\nwhat all her family suffered on his going away, she did\\nnot adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,\\non a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,\\nby seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means\\nwere as different as their objects, and equally suited\\nto the advancement of each.\\n\\nElinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he\\nwas out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,\\nneither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,\\nappeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\\ngeneral concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,\\nshe did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters\\nwere spared much solicitude on her account.\\n\\nSuch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse\\nof her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,\\nthan her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business\\nof self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\\naffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could\\nhave no merit.  That her sister\\'s affections WERE calm,\\nshe dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;\\nand of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,\\nby still loving and respecting that sister, in spite\\nof this mortifying conviction.\\n\\nWithout shutting herself up from her family,\\nor leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,\\nor lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,\\nElinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of Edward, and of Edward\\'s behaviour, in every\\npossible variety which the different state of her spirits\\nat different times could produce,--with tenderness,\\npity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments\\nin abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother\\nand sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\\nconversation was forbidden among them, and every effect\\nof solitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitably\\nat liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;\\nand the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,\\nmust be before her, must force her attention, and engross\\nher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\\n\\nFrom a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her\\ndrawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after\\nEdward\\'s leaving them, by the arrival of company.\\nShe happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the\\nlittle gate, at the entrance of the green court in front\\nof the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw\\na large party walking up to the door.  Amongst them\\nwere Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\\nbut there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were\\nquite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,\\nand as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest\\nof the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,\\nand stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the\\ncasement to speak to him, though the space was so short\\nbetween the door and the window, as to make it hardly\\npossible to speak at one without being heard at the other.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.\\nHow do you like them?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.\\nCharlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her\\nif you look this way.\"\\n\\nAs Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\\nof minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged\\nto be excused.\\n\\n\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we\\nare come? I see her instrument is open.\"\\n\\n\"She is walking, I believe.\"\\n\\nThey were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not\\npatience enough to wait till the door was opened before\\nshe told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,\\n\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?\\nAnd where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you\\nwill be glad of a little company to sit with you.\\nI have brought my other son and daughter to see you.\\nOnly think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard\\na carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them.\\nI thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel\\nBrandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think\\nI hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come\\nback again\"--\\n\\nElinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle\\nof her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady\\nMiddleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood\\nand Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they\\nall sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings\\ncontinued her story as she walked through the passage\\ninto the parlour, attended by Sir John.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady\\nMiddleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.\\nShe was short and plump, had a very pretty face,\\nand the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant\\nas her sister\\'s, but they were much more prepossessing.\\nShe came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,\\nexcept when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.\\nHer husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\\nand twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than\\nhis wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.\\nHe entered the room with a look of self-consequence,\\nslightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,\\nand, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,\\ntook up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it\\nas long as he staid.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed\\nby nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,\\nwas hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\\nand every thing in it burst forth.\\n\\n\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never\\nsaw anything so charming!  Only think, Mamma, how it\\nis improved since I was here last! I always thought it\\nsuch a sweet place, ma\\'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\\nbut you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister,\\nhow delightful every thing is! How I should like such\\na house for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\\n\\nMr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise\\nhis eyes from the newspaper.\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;\\n\"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had\\nnever been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,\\nand could not help looking with surprise at them both.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud\\nas she could, and continued her account of their surprise,\\nthe evening before, on seeing their friends, without\\nceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer laughed\\nheartily at the recollection of their astonishment,\\nand every body agreed, two or three times over, that it\\nhad been quite an agreeable surprise.\\n\\n\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"\\nadded Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,\\nand speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\\nby no one else, though they were seated on different sides\\nof the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they had\\nnot travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey\\nof it, for they came all round by London upon account\\nof some business, for you know (nodding significantly and\\npointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.\\nI wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,\\nbut she would come with us; she longed so much to see\\nyou all!\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her\\nany harm.\\n\\n\"She expects to be confined in February,\"\\ncontinued Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nLady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,\\nand therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there\\nwas any news in the paper.\\n\\n\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\\n\\n\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.  \"Now, Palmer,\\nyou shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"\\n\\nHe immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,\\nand ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,\\nas soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;\\nand Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,\\nas to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up\\non her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,\\nand then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer\\'s eye\\nwas now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.\\nShe got up to examine them.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!\\nDo but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;\\nI could look at them for ever.\" And then sitting down again,\\nshe very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.\\n\\nWhen Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer\\nrose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself\\nand looked at them all around.\\n\\n\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\\n\\nHe made her no answer; and only observed, after again\\nexamining the room, that it was very low pitched,\\nand that the ceiling was crooked.  He then made his bow,\\nand departed with the rest.\\n\\nSir John had been very urgent with them all to\\nspend the next day at the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did\\nnot chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\\nat the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\\nher daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no\\ncuriosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,\\nand no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.\\nThey attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;\\nthe weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.\\nBut Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should\\nbe sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too,\\nthough she did not press their mother, pressed them.\\nMrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all\\nseemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young\\nladies were obliged to yield.\\n\\n\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they\\nwere gone.  \"The rent of this cottage is said to be low;\\nbut we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine\\nat the park whenever any one is staying either with them,\\nor with us.\"\\n\\n\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by\\nthose which we received from them a few weeks ago.\\nThe alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown\\ntedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\n\\nAs the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park\\nthe next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at\\nthe other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.\\nShe took them all most affectionately by the hand,\\nand expressed great delight in seeing them again.\\n\\n\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself\\nbetween Elinor and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was\\nafraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,\\nas we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons\\ncome to us next week you know.  It was quite a sudden thing\\nour coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage\\nwas coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\\nwould go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never\\ntells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;\\nhowever we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.\"\\n\\nThey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\\n\\n\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,\\n\"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  I could\\nget the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,\\nin Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I am sure\\nI shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\\nI am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go\\ninto public.\"\\n\\nThey thanked her; but were obliged to resist all\\nher entreaties.\\n\\n\"Oh, my love,\" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband,\\nwho just then entered the room--\"you must help me to\\npersuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter.\"\\n\\nHer love made no answer; and after slightly bowing\\nto the ladies, began complaining of the weather.\\n\\n\"How horrid all this is!\" said he.  \"Such weather\\nmakes every thing and every body disgusting.  Dullness\\nis as much produced within doors as without, by rain.\\nIt makes one detest all one\\'s acquaintance.  What the\\ndevil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room\\nin his house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir\\nJohn is as stupid as the weather.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the company soon dropt in.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\" said Sir John, \"you have\\nnot been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked very grave and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer;\\n\"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your\\ntaste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome.\\nWe do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.\\nNot above ten miles, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\\n\\n\"Ah, well! there is not much difference.\\nI never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet\\npretty place.\"\\n\\n\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\"\\nsaid Mr. Palmer.\\n\\nMarianne remained perfectly silent, though her\\ncountenance betrayed her interest in what was said.\\n\\n\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it\\nmust be some other place that is so pretty I suppose.\"\\n\\nWhen they were seated in the dining room, Sir John\\nobserved with regret that they were only eight all together.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking\\nthat we should be so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts\\nto come to us today?\"\\n\\n\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me\\nabout it before, that it could not be done?  They dined\\nwith us last.\"\\n\\n\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\n\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.\\n\\n\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife\\nwith her usual laugh.  \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling\\nyour mother ill-bred.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured\\nold lady, \"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot\\ngive her back again.  So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\\n\\nCharlotte laughed heartily to think that her\\nhusband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,\\nshe did not care how cross he was to her, as they must\\nlive together.  It was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy\\nthan Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,\\nand discontent of her husband gave her no pain;\\nand when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,\\nto Elinor.  \"He is always out of humour.\"\\n\\nElinor was not inclined, after a little observation,\\nto give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\\nill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.\\nHis temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,\\nlike many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\\nwoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too\\ncommon for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--\\nIt was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,\\nwhich produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,\\nand his general abuse of every thing before him.\\nIt was the desire of appearing superior to other people.\\nThe motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,\\nhowever they might succeed by establishing his superiority\\nin ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him\\nexcept his wife.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,\\n\"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.\\nWill you come and spend some time at Cleveland this\\nChristmas?  Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are\\nwith us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!  It will\\nbe quite delightful!--My love,\" applying to her husband,\\n\"don\\'t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came\\ninto Devonshire with no other view.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer\\nexpects you; so you cannot refuse to come.\"\\n\\nThey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\\n\\n\"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you\\nwill like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,\\nand it will be quite delightful.  You cannot think\\nwhat a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,\\nfor Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election; and so many people came to dine\\nwith us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!  But,\\npoor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced\\nto make every body like him.\"\\n\\nElinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\\nassented to the hardship of such an obligation.\\n\\n\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he\\nis in Parliament!--won\\'t it? How I shall laugh!  It will\\nbe so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\\nwith an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank\\nfor me?  He declares he won\\'t.  Don\\'t you, Mr. Palmer?\"\\n\\nMr. Palmer took no notice of her.\\n\\n\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--\\n\"he says it is quite shocking.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational.\\nDon\\'t palm all your abuses of languages upon me.\"\\n\\n\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always\\nthe way with him!  Sometimes he won\\'t speak to me for half\\na day together, and then he comes out with something\\nso droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\\n\\nShe surprised Elinor very much as they returned\\ninto the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did\\nnot like Mr. Palmer excessively.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would,\\nhe is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased\\nwith you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can\\'t\\nthink how disappointed he will be if you don\\'t come\\nto Cleveland.--I can\\'t imagine why you should object\\nto it.\"\\n\\nElinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;\\nand by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.\\nShe thought it probable that as they lived in the\\nsame county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\\nmore particular account of Willoughby\\'s general\\ncharacter, than could be gathered from the Middletons\\'\\npartial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain\\nfrom any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might\\nremove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began\\nby inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\\n\\n\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\"\\nreplied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not that I ever spoke\\nto him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.\\nSomehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton\\nwhile he was at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--\\nbut I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  However, I dare say\\nwe should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,\\nif it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\\nhave been in the country together.  He is very little\\nat Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,\\nI do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is\\nin the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a\\nway off.  I know why you inquire about him, very well;\\nyour sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it,\\nfor then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much\\nmore of the matter than I do, if you have any reason\\nto expect such a match.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t pretend to deny it, because you know it is\\nwhat every body talks of.  I assure you I heard of it\\nin my way through town.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon\\nMonday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,\\nand he told me of it directly.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell\\nyou of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  To give such\\nintelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,\\neven if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel\\nBrandon to do.\"\\n\\n\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that,\\nand I will tell you how it happened.  When we met him,\\nhe turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking\\nof my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\\nand I said to him, \\'So, Colonel, there is a new family\\ncome to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word\\nthey are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be\\nmarried to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.  Is it true,\\npray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\\nDevonshire so lately.\\'\"\\n\\n\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\\n\\n\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he\\nknew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down\\nas certain.  It will be quite delightful, I declare!\\nWhen is it to take place?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,\\nhe did nothing but say fine things of you.\"\\n\\n\"I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems\\nan excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\\n\\n\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it\\nis quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.\\nMamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--\\nI assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he\\nhardly ever falls in love with any body.\"\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part\\nof Somersetshire?\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe\\nmany people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna\\nis so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable\\nI assure you.  Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby\\nwherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.\\nShe is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;\\nnot but that he is much more lucky in getting her,\\nbecause she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing\\ncan be good enough for her.  However, I don\\'t think\\nher hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;\\nfor I think you both excessively pretty, and so does\\nMr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him\\nto own it last night.\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s information respecting Willoughby\\nwas not very material; but any testimony in his favour,\\nhowever small, was pleasing to her.\\n\\n\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\"\\ncontinued Charlotte.--\"And now I hope we shall always be\\ngreat friends.  You can\\'t think how much I longed to see you!\\nIt is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!\\nNothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I am so glad\\nyour sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will\\nbe a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place,\\nby all accounts.\"\\n\\n\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon,\\nhave not you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--\\nHe was a particular friend of Sir John\\'s. I believe,\"\\nshe added in a low voice, \"he would have been very\\nglad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John and Lady\\nMiddleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think\\nthe match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would\\nhave mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been\\nmarried immediately.\"\\n\\n\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John\\'s proposal\\nto your mother before it was made?  Had he never owned\\nhis affection to yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,\\nI dare say he would have liked it of all things.\\nHe had not seen me then above twice, for it was before\\nI left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.\\nMr. Palmer is the kind of man I like.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\n\\nThe Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day,\\nand the two families at Barton were again left to entertain\\neach other.  But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly\\ngot their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done\\nwondering at Charlotte\\'s being so happy without a cause,\\nat Mr. Palmer\\'s acting so simply, with good abilities,\\nand at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\\nhusband and wife, before Sir John\\'s and Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nactive zeal in the cause of society, procured her some\\nother new acquaintance to see and observe.\\n\\nIn a morning\\'s excursion to Exeter, they had met with\\ntwo young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction\\nof discovering to be her relations, and this was enough\\nfor Sir John to invite them directly to the park,\\nas soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\\nTheir engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before\\nsuch an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into\\nno little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing\\nthat she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\\nwhom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--\\nwhose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;\\nfor the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\\nwent for nothing at all.  Their being her relations too\\nmade it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings\\'s attempts\\nat consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,\\nwhen she advised her daughter not to care about their being\\nso fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to\\nprevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the\\nidea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,\\ncontenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\\nreprimand on the subject five or six times every day.\\n\\nThe young ladies arrived: their appearance was by\\nno means ungenteel or unfashionable.  Their dress was\\nvery smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted\\nwith the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\\nthat Lady Middleton\\'s good opinion was engaged in their\\nfavour before they had been an hour at the Park.\\nShe declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,\\nwhich for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.\\nSir John\\'s confidence in his own judgment rose with this\\nanimated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage\\nto tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles\\' arrival,\\nand to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\\nin the world.  From such commendation as this, however,\\nthere was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew\\nthat the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\\nwith in every part of England, under every possible\\nvariation of form, face, temper and understanding.\\nSir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly\\nand look at his guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It\\nwas painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.\\n\\n\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I\\ndeclare you shall come--You can\\'t think how you will\\nlike them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured\\nand agreeable!  The children are all hanging about her already,\\nas if she was an old acquaintance.  And they both long\\nto see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter\\nthat you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;\\nand I have told them it is all very true, and a great\\ndeal more.  You will be delighted with them I am sure.\\nThey have brought the whole coach full of playthings\\nfor the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?\\nWhy they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.\\nYOU are my cousins, and they are my wife\\'s, so you must\\nbe related.\"\\n\\nBut Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain\\na promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,\\nand then left them in amazement at their indifference,\\nto walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\\nMiss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss\\nSteeles to them.\\n\\nWhen their promised visit to the Park and consequent\\nintroduction to these young ladies took place, they found\\nin the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,\\nwith a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;\\nbut in the other, who was not more than two or three\\nand twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\\nfeatures were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,\\nand a smartness of air, which though it did not give\\nactual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--\\nTheir manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she\\nsaw with what constant and judicious attention they\\nwere making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.\\nWith her children they were in continual raptures,\\nextolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\\ntheir whims; and such of their time as could be spared from\\nthe importunate demands which this politeness made on it,\\nwas spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,\\nif she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns\\nof some elegant new dress, in which her appearance\\nthe day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\\nFortunately for those who pay their court through\\nsuch foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise\\nfor her children, the most rapacious of human beings,\\nis likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;\\nbut she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\\naffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards\\nher offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton\\nwithout the smallest surprise or distrust.  She saw with\\nmaternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\\nand mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\\nShe saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about\\ntheir ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives\\nand scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being\\na reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other surprise\\nthan that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing.\\n\\n\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his\\ntaking Miss Steeles\\'s pocket handkerchief, and throwing\\nit out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks.\"\\n\\nAnd soon afterwards, on the second boy\\'s violently\\npinching one of the same lady\\'s fingers, she fondly observed,\\n\"How playful William is!\"\\n\\n\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added,\\ntenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,\\nwho had not made a noise for the last two minutes;\\n\"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there\\nsuch a quiet little thing!\"\\n\\nBut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,\\na pin in her ladyship\\'s head dress slightly scratching\\nthe child\\'s neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness\\nsuch violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any\\ncreature professedly noisy.  The mother\\'s consternation\\nwas excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the\\nMiss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three,\\nin so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest\\nas likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.\\nShe was seated in her mother\\'s lap, covered with kisses,\\nher wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the\\nMiss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her,\\nand her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.\\nWith such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise\\nto cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily,\\nkicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all\\ntheir united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton\\nluckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress\\nlast week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully\\napplied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight\\nintermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it,\\ngave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--\\nShe was carried out of the room therefore in her\\nmother\\'s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the\\ntwo boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated\\nby their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies\\nwere left in a quietness which the room had not known for\\nmany hours.\\n\\n\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon\\nas they were gone.  \"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\\n\\n\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it\\nhad been under totally different circumstances.\\nBut this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there\\nis nothing to be alarmed at in reality.\"\\n\\n\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\\n\\nMarianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say\\nwhat she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;\\nand upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies\\nwhen politeness required it, always fell.  She did her\\nbest when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton\\nwith more warmth than she felt, though with far less than\\nMiss Lucy.\\n\\n\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister,\\n\"what a charming man he is!\"\\n\\nHere too, Miss Dashwood\\'s commendation, being only\\nsimple and just, came in without any eclat.  She merely\\nobserved that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.\\n\\n\"And what a charming little family they have!  I\\nnever saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I\\nquite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always\\ndistractedly fond of children.\"\\n\\n\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile,\\n\"from what I have witnessed this morning.\"\\n\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little\\nMiddletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the\\noutside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton;\\nand for my part, I love to see children full of life\\nand spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.\"\\n\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at\\nBarton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children\\nwith any abhorrence.\"\\n\\nA short pause succeeded this speech, which was first\\nbroken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed\\nfor conversation, and who now said rather abruptly,\\n\"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?  I suppose\\nyou were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\\n\\nIn some surprise at the familiarity of this question,\\nor at least of the manner in which it was spoken,\\nElinor replied that she was.\\n\\n\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\"\\nadded Miss Steele.\\n\\n\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\"\\nsaid Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary\\nfor the freedom of her sister.\\n\\n\"I think every one MUST admire it,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed\\nthat any one can estimate its beauties as we do.\"\\n\\n\"And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I\\nsuppose you have not so many in this part of the world;\\nfor my part, I think they are a vast addition always.\"\\n\\n\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed\\nof her sister, \"that there are not as many genteel young\\nmen in Devonshire as Sussex?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, my dear, I\\'m sure I don\\'t pretend to say that there\\nan\\'t.  I\\'m sure there\\'s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter;\\nbut you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there\\nmight be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss\\nDashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not\\nso many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies\\nmay not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without\\nthem as with them.  For my part, I think they are vastly\\nagreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.\\nBut I can\\'t bear to see them dirty and nasty.  Now there\\'s\\nMr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\\nquite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you\\ndo but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--\\nI suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,\\nbefore he married, as he was so rich?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you,\\nfor I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.\\nBut this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before\\nhe married, he is one still for there is not the smallest\\nalteration in him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men\\'s being\\nbeaux--they have something else to do.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of\\nnothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you\\nthink of nothing else.\" And then to turn the discourse,\\nshe began admiring the house and the furniture.\\n\\nThis specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.\\nThe vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\\nher no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded\\nby the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,\\nto her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left\\nthe house without any wish of knowing them better.\\n\\nNot so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well\\nprovided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,\\nhis family, and all his relations, and no niggardly\\nproportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they\\ndeclared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,\\nand agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--\\nAnd to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found\\nwas their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely\\non the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be\\ntoo strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy\\nmust be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour\\nor two together in the same room almost every day.\\nSir John could do no more; but he did not know that any\\nmore was required: to be together was, in his opinion,\\nto be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\\nmeeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\\nestablished friends.\\n\\nTo do him justice, he did every thing in his power\\nto promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles\\nacquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins\\'\\nsituations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor\\nhad not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of\\nthem wished her joy on her sister\\'s having been so lucky\\nas to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she\\ncame to Barton.\\n\\n\"\\'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young\\nto be sure,\" said she, \"and I hear he is quite a beau,\\nand prodigious handsome.  And I hope you may have as good\\nluck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend\\nin the corner already.\"\\n\\nElinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more\\nnice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward,\\nthan he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was\\nrather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat\\nnewer and more conjectural; and since Edward\\'s visit,\\nthey had never dined together without his drinking to her\\nbest affections with so much significancy and so many nods\\nand winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--\\nhad been likewise invariably brought forward, and found\\nproductive of such countless jokes, that its character\\nas the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long\\nestablished with Elinor.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the\\nbenefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they\\nraised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman\\nalluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,\\nwas perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not\\nsport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,\\nfor he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,\\nas Miss Steele had in hearing it.\\n\\n\"His name is Ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper;\\n\"but pray do not tell it, for it\\'s a great secret.\"\\n\\n\"Ferrars!\" repeated Miss Steele; \"Mr. Ferrars is\\nthe happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law\\'s brother,\\nMiss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;\\nI know him very well.\"\\n\\n\"How can you say so, Anne?\" cried Lucy, who generally\\nmade an amendment to all her sister\\'s assertions.\\n\"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle\\'s, it\\nis rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\"\\n\\nElinor heard all this with attention and surprise.\\n\"And who was this uncle?  Where did he live?  How came\\nthey acquainted?\"  She wished very much to have the subject\\ncontinued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself;\\nbut nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\\nin her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either\\nin curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition\\nto communicate it.  The manner in which Miss Steele had\\nspoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck\\nher as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion\\nof that lady\\'s knowing, or fancying herself to know something\\nto his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing,\\nfor no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars\\'s name by\\nMiss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir\\nJohn.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\n\\nMarianne, who had never much toleration for any\\nthing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,\\nor even difference of taste from herself, was at\\nthis time particularly ill-disposed, from the state\\nof her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles,\\nor to encourage their advances; and to the invariable\\ncoldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every\\nendeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally\\nattributed that preference of herself which soon became\\nevident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy,\\nwho missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,\\nor of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy\\nand frank communication of her sentiments.\\n\\nLucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often\\njust and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour\\nElinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers\\nhad received no aid from education: she was ignorant\\nand illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\\nher want of information in the most common particulars,\\ncould not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her\\nconstant endeavour to appear to advantage.  Elinor saw,\\nand pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education\\nmight have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less\\ntenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\\nof rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,\\nher assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;\\nand she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company\\nof a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;\\nwhose want of instruction prevented their meeting\\nin conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct\\ntoward others made every shew of attention and deference\\ntowards herself perfectly valueless.\\n\\n\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\"\\nsaid Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together\\nfrom the park to the cottage--\"but pray, are you\\npersonally acquainted with your sister-in-law\\'s mother,\\nMrs. Ferrars?\"\\n\\nElinor DID think the question a very odd one,\\nand her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she\\nhad never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I\\nthought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.\\nThen, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman\\nshe is?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real\\nopinion of Edward\\'s mother, and not very desirous\\nof satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--\\n\"I know nothing of her.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring\\nabout her in such a way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively\\nas she spoke; \"but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish\\nI might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice\\nof believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.\"\\n\\nElinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on\\nfor a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,\\nwho renewed the subject again by saying, with some\\nhesitation,\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.\\nI am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be\\nthought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\\nhaving as yours.  And I am sure I should not have the smallest\\nfear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your\\nadvice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation\\nas I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.\\nI am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry I do NOT,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment,\\n\"if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.\\nBut really I never understood that you were at all connected\\nwith that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,\\nI confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all\\nwonder at it.  But if I dared tell you all, you would not be\\nso much surprised.  Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me\\nat present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come\\nmust depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately\\nconnected.\"\\n\\nShe looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,\\nwith only one side glance at her companion to observe its\\neffect on her.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean?\\nAre you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?\"\\nAnd she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such\\na sister-in-law.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I\\nnever saw him in my life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor,\\n\"to his eldest brother.\"\\n\\nWhat felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,\\nthat would have been as painful as it was strong, had not\\nan immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.\\nShe turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine\\nthe reason or object of such a declaration; and though\\nher complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,\\nand felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy;\\n\"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;\\nfor I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\\nto you or any of your family; because it was always meant\\nto be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\\nkept so by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations\\nknow of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned\\nit to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence\\nin the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my\\nbehaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars\\nmust seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.\\nAnd I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,\\nwhen he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has\\nthe highest opinion in the world of all your family,\\nand looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite\\nas his own sisters.\"--She paused.\\n\\nElinor for a few moments remained silent.\\nHer astonishment at what she heard was at first too\\ngreat for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,\\nand to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\\n\"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?\"\\n\\n\"We have been engaged these four years.\"\\n\\n\"Four years!\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nElinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable\\nto believe it.\\n\\n\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even\\nacquainted till the other day.\"\\n\\n\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.\\nHe was under my uncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"\\n\\n\"Your uncle!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk\\nof Mr. Pratt?\"\\n\\n\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion\\nof spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.\\n\\n\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple,\\nnear Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun,\\nfor my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,\\nand it was there our engagement was formed, though not till\\na year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost\\nalways with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and\\napprobation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved\\nhim too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--\\nThough you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,\\nyou must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\\nvery capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what\\nshe said; but after a moment\\'s reflection, she added,\\nwith revived security of Edward\\'s honour and love,\\nand her companion\\'s falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\\nFerrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at\\nwhat you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;\\nbut surely there must be some mistake of person or name.\\nWe cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward\\nFerrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,\\nand brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nis the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely\\nto be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\\ndepends.\"\\n\\n\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,\\n\"that I should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\\n\\n\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.\\nOur first care has been to keep the matter secret.--\\nYou knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,\\nthere could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name\\nto you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his\\nsister\\'s suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough\\nfor his not mentioning it.\"\\n\\nShe was silent.--Elinor\\'s security sunk; but her\\nself-command did not sink with it.\\n\\n\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she\\nwith a firm voice.\\n\\n\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have\\nto wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\"\\nThen taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,\\n\"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look\\nat this face.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,\\nbut yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person\\nit was drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"\\n\\nShe put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor\\nsaw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a\\ntoo hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood\\nmight suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of\\nits being Edward\\'s face.  She returned it almost instantly,\\nacknowledging the likeness.\\n\\n\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give\\nhim my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,\\nfor he has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am\\ndetermined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.\\nThey then proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world\\nof your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must\\nknow of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach\\nhis mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.\\nI shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\\nproud woman.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;\\n\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I\\nmay be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;\\nbut pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary\\na communication.  You must at least have felt that my\\nbeing acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\\n\\nAs she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,\\nhoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the\\nfalsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;\\nbut Lucy\\'s countenance suffered no change.\\n\\n\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great\\nliberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.\\nI have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,\\nbut I have known you and all your family by description\\na great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if\\nyou was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case,\\nI really thought some explanation was due to you after my\\nmaking such particular inquiries about Edward\\'s mother;\\nand I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose\\nadvice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that knows of it,\\nand she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great\\ndeal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\\nbetraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,\\nas you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest\\nfright in the world t\\'other day, when Edward\\'s name was\\nmentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.\\nYou can\\'t think how much I go through in my mind from\\nit altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what\\nI have suffered for Edward\\'s sake these last four years.\\nEvery thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing\\nhim so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.\\nI am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"\\n\\nHere she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did\\nnot feel very compassionate.\\n\\n\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,\\n\"I think whether it would not be better for us both\\nto break off the matter entirely.\"  As she said this,\\nshe looked directly at her companion.  \"But then\\nat other times I have not resolution enough for it.--\\nI cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,\\nas I know the very mention of such a thing would do.\\nAnd on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don\\'t\\nthink I could be equal to it.  What would you advise\\nme to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you\\ndo yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question;\\n\"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.\\nYour own judgment must direct you.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes\\nsilence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him\\nsometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!\\nDid you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at\\nBarton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,\\nto go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"\\n\\n\"Did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.\\nDid you think he came directly from town?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of\\nevery fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy\\'s veracity;\\n\"I remember he told us, that he had been staying\\na fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\\nShe remembered too, her own surprise at the time,\\nat his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,\\nat his total silence with respect even to their names.\\n\\n\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"\\nrepeated Lucy.\\n\\n\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you\\nshould suspect what was the matter; but it made him\\nso melancholy, not being able to stay more than a\\nfortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--\\nPoor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;\\nfor he writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just\\nbefore I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket\\nand carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.\\n\"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;\\nbut that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,\\nI dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\\nas possible.\"\\n\\nElinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt\\nno longer.  This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,\\nmight have been accidentally obtained; it might not have\\nbeen Edward\\'s gift; but a correspondence between them\\nby letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,\\ncould be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she\\nwas almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could\\nhardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;\\nand she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\\nof her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for\\nthe time complete.\\n\\n\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the\\nletter into her pocket, \"is the only comfort we have\\nin such long separations.  Yes, I have one other comfort\\nin his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.\\nIf he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.\\nI gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at\\nLongstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,\\nbut not equal to a picture.  Perhaps you might notice\\nthe ring when you saw him?\"\\n\\n\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice,\\nunder which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond\\nany thing she had ever felt before.  She was mortified,\\nshocked, confounded.\\n\\nFortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage,\\nand the conversation could be continued no farther.\\nAfter sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles\\nreturned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty\\nto think and be wretched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\n\\nHowever small Elinor\\'s general dependence on\\nLucy\\'s veracity might be, it was impossible for her\\non serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,\\nwhere no temptation could be answerable to the folly\\nof inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy\\nhad asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,\\ndared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every\\nside by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted\\nby nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of\\nacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation\\nfor the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward\\'s\\nvisit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,\\nhis dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain\\nbehaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the\\nMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections,\\nwhich had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,\\nthe ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,\\nas overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,\\nand established as a fact, which no partiality could\\nset aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment\\nof such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself;\\nbut other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.\\nHad Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he feigned\\na regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement\\nto Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might\\nonce have been, she could not believe it such at present.\\nHis affection was all her own.  She could not be deceived\\nin that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been\\nconscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not\\nan illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.\\nWhat a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  How much\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive!  He had been blamable,\\nhighly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first\\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought\\nto be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he\\nhad injured her, how much more had he injured himself;\\nif her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.\\nHis imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it\\nseemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever\\nbeing otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity;\\nbut HE, what had he to look forward to?  Could he\\never be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he,\\nwere his affection for herself out of the question,\\nwith his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,\\nbe satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,\\nand selfish?\\n\\nThe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally\\nblind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;\\nbut the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally\\nspent, give such improvement to the understanding, must\\nhave opened his eyes to her defects of education,\\nwhile the same period of time, spent on her side\\nin inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,\\nhad perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might\\nonce have given an interesting character to her beauty.\\n\\nIf in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself,\\nhis difficulties from his mother had seemed great,\\nhow much greater were they now likely to be, when\\nthe object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior\\nin connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.\\nThese difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated\\nfrom Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;\\nbut melancholy was the state of the person by whom the\\nexpectation of family opposition and unkindness, could\\nbe felt as a relief!\\n\\nAs these considerations occurred to her in painful\\nsuccession, she wept for him, more than for herself.\\nSupported by the conviction of having done nothing to\\nmerit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief\\nthat Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,\\nshe thought she could even now, under the first smart\\nof the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every\\nsuspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.\\nAnd so well was she able to answer her own expectations,\\nthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours\\nafter she had first suffered the extinction of all her\\ndearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the\\nappearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning\\nin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\nfrom the object of her love, and that Marianne was\\ninternally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose\\nwhole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she\\nexpected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.\\n\\nThe necessity of concealing from her mother and\\nMarianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,\\nthough it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no\\naggravation of Elinor\\'s distress.  On the contrary\\nit was a relief to her, to be spared the communication\\nof what would give such affliction to them, and to be\\nsaved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward,\\nwhich would probably flow from the excess of their partial\\naffection for herself, and which was more than she felt\\nequal to support.\\n\\nFrom their counsel, or their conversation, she knew\\nshe could receive no assistance, their tenderness and\\nsorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command\\nwould neither receive encouragement from their example\\nnor from their praise.  She was stronger alone,\\nand her own good sense so well supported her, that her\\nfirmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness\\nas invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,\\nit was possible for them to be.\\n\\nMuch as she had suffered from her first conversation\\nwith Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish\\nof renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.\\nShe wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\\nrepeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand\\nwhat Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any\\nsincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,\\nand she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her\\nreadiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness\\nin conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested\\nin it than as a friend, which she very much feared\\nher involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,\\nmust have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed\\nto be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain\\nthat Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,\\nnot merely from Lucy\\'s assertion, but from her venturing\\nto trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,\\nwith a secret so confessedly and evidently important.\\nAnd even Sir John\\'s joking intelligence must have had\\nsome weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remained so well\\nassured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,\\nit required no other consideration of probabilities\\nto make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;\\nand that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.\\nWhat other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\\nthere be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy\\'s\\nsuperior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him\\nin future?  She had little difficulty in understanding thus\\nmuch of her rival\\'s intentions, and while she was firmly\\nresolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\\nhonesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward\\nand to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy\\nthat her heart was unwounded.  And as she could now have\\nnothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\\nbeen told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going\\nthrough a repetition of particulars with composure.\\n\\nBut it was not immediately that an opportunity\\nof doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well\\ndisposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;\\nfor the weather was not often fine enough to allow\\nof their joining in a walk, where they might most easily\\nseparate themselves from the others; and though they\\nmet at least every other evening either at the park\\nor cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could\\nnot be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.\\nSuch a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s head; and therefore very little leisure\\nwas ever given for a general chat, and none at all for\\nparticular discourse.  They met for the sake of eating,\\ndrinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\\nor consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\\n\\nOne or two meetings of this kind had taken place,\\nwithout affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy\\nin private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,\\nto beg, in the name of charity, that they would all\\ndine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged\\nto attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be\\nquite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.\\nElinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\\nhad in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,\\nmore at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when\\nher husband united them together in one noisy purpose,\\nimmediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her\\nmother\\'s permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,\\nthough always unwilling to join any of their parties,\\nwas persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\\n\\nThe young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily\\npreserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.\\nThe insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor\\nhad expected; it produced not one novelty of thought\\nor expression, and nothing could be less interesting\\nthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\nparlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children\\naccompanied them, and while they remained there, she was\\ntoo well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy\\'s\\nattention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the\\nremoval of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed,\\nand Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation\\nat the park.  They all rose up in preparation for a round game.\\n\\n\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy,\\n\"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria\\'s\\nbasket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your\\neyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make\\nthe dear little love some amends for her disappointment\\nto-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.\"\\n\\nThis hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly\\nand replied, \"Indeed you are very much mistaken,\\nLady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can\\nmake your party without me, or I should have been at my\\nfiligree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,\\nI am resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\\n\\n\"You are very good, I hope it won\\'t hurt your eyes--\\nwill you ring the bell for some working candles?\\nMy poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know,\\nif the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I\\ntold her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends\\nupon having it done.\"\\n\\nLucy directly drew her work table near her\\nand reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\\nwhich seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\\ndelight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\\n\\nLady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.\\nNo one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual\\ninattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,\\n\"Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you\\nknow I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;\\nI have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  And without\\nfarther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\\n\\nLady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven\\nthat SHE had never made so rude a speech.\\n\\n\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument\\nyou know, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth\\naway the offence; \"and I do not much wonder at it; for it\\nis the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard.\"\\n\\nThe remaining five were now to draw their cards.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen\\nto cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,\\nin rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still\\nto be done to the basket, that it must be impossible\\nI think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.\\nI should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow\\nme a share in it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you\\nfor your help,\" cried Lucy, \"for I find there is more\\nto be done to it than I thought there was; and it would\\nbe a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele--\\n\"Dear little soul, how I do love her!\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor;\\n\"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be\\nas well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,\\nor will you take your chance now?\"\\n\\nElinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals,\\nand thus by a little of that address which Marianne\\ncould never condescend to practise, gained her own end,\\nand pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.  Lucy made room\\nfor her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were\\nthus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.\\nThe pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own\\nmusic and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten\\nthat any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily\\nso near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,\\nunder the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\n\\nIn a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\\n\\n\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have\\nhonoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,\\nor no farther curiosity on its subject.  I will\\nnot apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking\\nthe ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was\\nsomehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I\\ntold you that Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\"\\nand Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,\\n\"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give\\nyou such an idea.  Could you have a motive for the trust,\\nthat was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\\n\\n\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little\\nsharp eyes full of meaning, \"there seemed to me to be\\na coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\\nquite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was angry with me;\\nand have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\\ntook such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.\\nBut I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,\\nand that you really do not blame me.  If you knew what a\\nconsolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\\nof what I am always thinking of every moment of my life,\\nyour compassion would make you overlook every thing else\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great\\nrelief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be\\nassured that you shall never have reason to repent it.\\nYour case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to\\nbe surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need\\nof all your mutual affection to support you under them.\\nMr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\\n\\n\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would\\nbe madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,\\nI could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.\\nI have been always used to a very small income, and could\\nstruggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well\\nto be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that\\nhis mother might give him if he married to please her.\\nWe must wait, it may be for many years.  With almost every\\nother man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;\\nbut Edward\\'s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\\nI know.\"\\n\\n\"That conviction must be every thing to you;\\nand he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your\\'s.\\nIf the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed,\\nas between many people, and under many circumstances\\nit naturally would during a four years\\' engagement,\\nyour situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\\n\\nLucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful\\nin guarding her countenance from every expression\\nthat could give her words a suspicious tendency.\\n\\n\"Edward\\'s love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty\\nwell put to the test, by our long, very long absence\\nsince we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial\\nso well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.\\nI can safely say that he has never gave me one moment\\'s\\nalarm on that account from the first.\"\\n\\nElinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh\\nat this assertion.\\n\\nLucy went on.  \"I am rather of a jealous temper too\\nby nature, and from our different situations in life,\\nfrom his being so much more in the world than me, and our\\ncontinual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion,\\nto have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been\\nthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,\\nor any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,\\nor if he had talked more of one lady than another,\\nor seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he\\nused to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly\\nobservant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\\nI am sure I could not be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"All this,\" thought Elinor, \"is very pretty;\\nbut it can impose upon neither of us.\"\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she after a short silence,\\n\"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for\\nMrs. Ferrars\\'s death, which is a melancholy and shocking\\nextremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this,\\nand to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\\nin which it may involve you, rather than run the risk\\nof her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?\"\\n\\n\"If we could be certain that it would be only\\nfor a while!  But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong\\nproud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing\\nit, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,\\nand the idea of that, for Edward\\'s sake, frightens away\\nall my inclination for hasty measures.\"\\n\\n\"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying\\nyour disinterestedness beyond reason.\"\\n\\nLucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.\\n\\n\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor.\\n\\n\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he\\nis very unlike his brother--silly and a great coxcomb.\"\\n\\n\"A great coxcomb!\" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had\\ncaught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne\\'s music.--\\n\"Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No sister,\" cried Lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our\\nfavourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs.\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood\\'s is not,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; \"for he is one\\nof the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw;\\nbut as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature,\\nthere is no finding out who SHE likes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round\\nat them, \"I dare say Lucy\\'s beau is quite as modest\\nand pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood\\'s.\"\\n\\nElinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip,\\nand looked angrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took\\nplace for some time.  Lucy first put an end to it by saying\\nin a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them\\nthe powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--\\n\\n\"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has\\nlately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;\\nindeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you\\nare a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen enough\\nof Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\nother profession; now my plan is that he should take\\norders as soon as he can, and then through your interest,\\nwhich I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\\nfriendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me,\\nyour brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;\\nwhich I understand is a very good one, and the present\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while.  That would\\nbe enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time\\nand chance for the rest.\"\\n\\n\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show\\nany mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars;\\nbut do you not perceive that my interest on such an\\noccasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is brother\\nto Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough\\nto her husband.\"\\n\\n\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve\\nof Edward\\'s going into orders.\"\\n\\n\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would\\ndo very little.\"\\n\\nThey were again silent for many minutes.  At length\\nLucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,\\n\\n\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end\\nto the business at once by dissolving the engagement.\\nWe seem so beset with difficulties on every side,\\nthat though it would make us miserable for a time,\\nwe should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will\\nnot give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed\\nvery agitated feelings, \"on such a subject I certainly\\nwill not.  You know very well that my opinion would have\\nno weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great\\nsolemnity; \"I know nobody of whose judgment I think\\nso highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe,\\nthat if you was to say to me, \\'I advise you by all means\\nto put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,\\nit will be more for the happiness of both of you,\\'\\nI should resolve upon doing it immediately.\"\\n\\nElinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward\\'s\\nfuture wife, and replied, \"This compliment would effectually\\nfrighten me from giving any opinion on the subject\\nhad I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;\\nthe power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\nis too much for an indifferent person.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy,\\nwith some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,\\n\"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.\\nIf you could be supposed to be biased in any respect\\nby your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having.\"\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this,\\nlest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase\\nof ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined\\nnever to mention the subject again.  Another pause\\ntherefore of many minutes\\' duration, succeeded this speech,\\nand Lucy was still the first to end it.\\n\\n\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\"\\nsaid she with all her accustomary complacency.\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other,\\nwhile her eyes brightened at the information,\\n\"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there!\\nBut I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure,\\nyour brother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"\\n\\n\"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation\\nif they do.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon\\nmeeting you there.  Anne and me are to go the latter end\\nof January to some relations who have been wanting us to\\nvisit them these several years!  But I only go for the sake\\nof seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise\\nLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"\\n\\nElinor was soon called to the card-table by the\\nconclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential\\ndiscourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,\\nto which both of them submitted without any reluctance,\\nfor nothing had been said on either side to make them\\ndislike each other less than they had done before;\\nand Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy\\npersuasion that Edward was not only without affection\\nfor the person who was to be his wife; but that he had\\nnot even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,\\nwhich sincere affection on HER side would have given,\\nfor self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man\\nto an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware\\nthat he was weary.\\n\\nFrom this time the subject was never revived by Elinor,\\nand when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity\\nof introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform\\nher confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter\\nfrom Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness\\nand caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;\\nfor she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which\\nLucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.\\n\\nThe visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was\\nlengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.\\nTheir favour increased; they could not be spared;\\nSir John would not hear of their going; and in spite\\nof their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter,\\nin spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill\\nthem immediately, which was in full force at the end\\nof every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two\\nmonths at the park, and to assist in the due celebration\\nof that festival which requires a more than ordinary\\nshare of private balls and large dinners to proclaim\\nits importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25\\n\\n\\nThough Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large\\nportion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,\\nshe was not without a settled habitation of her own.\\nSince the death of her husband, who had traded with success\\nin a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every\\nwinter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square.\\nTowards this home, she began on the approach of January\\nto turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,\\nand very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses\\nDashwood to accompany her.  Elinor, without observing\\nthe varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look\\nwhich spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave\\na grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations.\\nThe reason alleged was their determined resolution\\nof not leaving their mother at that time of the year.\\nMrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise,\\nand repeated her invitation immediately.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you\\nvery well, and I DO beg you will favour me with\\nyour company, for I\\'ve quite set my heart upon it.\\nDon\\'t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me,\\nfor I shan\\'t put myself at all out of my way for you.\\nIt will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I\\nhope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to go\\nvery well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\\nif you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good,\\nyou may always go with one of my daughters.  I am sure\\nyour mother will not object to it; for I have had such\\ngood luck in getting my own children off my hands that she\\nwill think me a very fit person to have the charge of you;\\nand if I don\\'t get one of you at least well married\\nbefore I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.\\nI shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,\\nyou may depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne\\nwould not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister\\nwould come into it.  It is very hard indeed that she\\nshould not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood\\ndoes not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off\\nfor town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying\\na word to Miss Dashwood about it.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be\\nmonstrous glad of Miss Marianne\\'s company, whether Miss\\nDashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I,\\nand I thought it would be more comfortable for them to\\nbe together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk\\nto one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.\\nBut one or the other, if not both of them, I must have.\\nLord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself,\\nI who have been always used till this winter to have\\nCharlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike\\nhands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change\\nher mind by and bye, why so much the better.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, ma\\'am, sincerely thank you,\" said Marianne,\\nwith warmth: \"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever,\\nand it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest\\nhappiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.\\nBut my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the\\njustice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be\\nmade less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no,\\nnothing should tempt me to leave her.  It should not,\\nmust not be a struggle.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood\\ncould spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now\\nunderstood her sister, and saw to what indifference to\\nalmost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\\nto be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her\\nmother\\'s decision, from whom however she scarcely expected\\nto receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,\\nwhich she could not approve of for Marianne, and which\\non her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.\\nWhatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager\\nto promote--she could not expect to influence the latter\\nto cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she\\nhad never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she\\ndared not explain the motive of her own disinclination\\nfor going to London.  That Marianne, fastidious as she was,\\nthoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings\\' manners,\\nand invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every\\ninconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever\\nmust be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her\\npursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,\\nso full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,\\nin spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.\\n\\nOn being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood,\\npersuaded that such an excursion would be productive\\nof much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving\\nthrough all her affectionate attention to herself,\\nhow much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear\\nof their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on\\ntheir both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,\\nwith her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that\\nwould accrue to them all, from this separation.\\n\\n\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried,\\n\"it is exactly what I could wish.  Margaret and I shall\\nbe as much benefited by it as yourselves.  When you\\nand the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly\\nand happily together with our books and our music! You\\nwill find Margaret so improved when you come back again!\\nI have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too,\\nwhich may now be performed without any inconvenience\\nto any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to town;\\nI would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of London.\\nYou will be under the care of a motherly good sort\\nof woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt.\\nAnd in all probability you will see your brother,\\nand whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,\\nwhen I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so\\nwholly estranged from each other.\"\\n\\n\"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"you have been obviating every impediment\\nto the present scheme which occurred to you, there is\\nstill one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so\\neasily removed.\"\\n\\nMarianne\\'s countenance sunk.\\n\\n\"And what,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"is my dear prudent\\nElinor going to suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she\\nnow to bring forward?  Do let me hear a word about the\\nexpense of it.\"\\n\\n\"My objection is this; though I think very well of\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s heart, she is not a woman whose society\\ncan afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give\\nus consequence.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of\\nher society, separately from that of other people,\\nyou will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will\\nalmost always appear in public with Lady Middleton.\"\\n\\n\"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of\\nMrs. Jennings,\" said Marianne, \"at least it need not prevent\\nMY accepting her invitation.  I have no such scruples,\\nand I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness\\nof that kind with very little effort.\"\\n\\nElinor could not help smiling at this display of\\nindifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she\\nhad often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave\\nwith tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,\\nthat if her sister persisted in going, she would\\ngo likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne\\nshould be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,\\nor that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\\nof Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.\\nTo this determination she was the more easily reconciled,\\nby recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy\\'s account,\\nwas not to be in town before February; and that\\ntheir visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,\\nmight be previously finished.\\n\\n\"I will have you BOTH go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\\n\"these objections are nonsensical.  You will have much\\npleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;\\nand if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,\\nshe would foresee it there from a variety of sources;\\nshe would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law\\'s family.\"\\n\\nElinor had often wished for an opportunity of\\nattempting to weaken her mother\\'s dependence on the\\nattachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might\\nbe less when the whole truth were revealed, and now\\non this attack, though almost hopeless of success,\\nshe forced herself to begin her design by saying,\\nas calmly as she could, \"I like Edward Ferrars very much,\\nand shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest\\nof the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference\\nto me, whether I am ever known to them or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.\\nMarianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor\\nconjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.\\n\\nAfter very little farther discourse, it was finally\\nsettled that the invitation should be fully accepted.\\nMrs. Jennings received the information with a great\\ndeal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;\\nnor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John\\nwas delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety\\nwas the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,\\nto the number of inhabitants in London, was something.\\nEven Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted,\\nwhich was putting herself rather out of her way;\\nand as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had\\nnever been so happy in their lives as this intelligence\\nmade them.\\n\\nElinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\\nher wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\\nto feel.  With regard to herself, it was now a matter\\nof unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when\\nshe saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,\\nand her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,\\nrestored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more\\nthan her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied\\nwith the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust\\nthe consequence.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,\\nso great was the perturbation of her spirits and her\\nimpatience to be gone.  Her unwillingness to quit her\\nmother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the\\nmoment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\\nHer mother\\'s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor\\nwas the only one of the three, who seemed to consider\\nthe separation as any thing short of eternal.\\n\\nTheir departure took place in the first week in January.\\nThe Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss\\nSteeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit\\nit only with the rest of the family.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 26\\n\\n\\nElinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings,\\nand beginning a journey to London under her protection,\\nand as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,\\nso short had their acquaintance with that lady been,\\nso wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,\\nand so many had been her objections against such a measure\\nonly a few days before! But these objections had all,\\nwith that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother\\nequally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,\\nin spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby\\'s constancy,\\ncould not witness the rapture of delightful expectation\\nwhich filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes\\nof Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,\\nhow cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,\\nand how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of\\nMarianne\\'s situation to have the same animating object\\nin view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a very\\nshort time however must now decide what Willoughby\\'s\\nintentions were; in all probability he was already in town.\\nMarianne\\'s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\\non finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon\\ngaining every new light as to his character which her\\nown observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\\nwith such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was\\nand what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\\nShould the result of her observations be unfavourable,\\nshe was determined at all events to open the eyes\\nof her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions\\nwould be of a different nature--she must then learn\\nto avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret\\nwhich might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\\n\\nThey were three days on their journey, and Marianne\\'s\\nbehaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what\\nfuture complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings\\nmight be expected to be.  She sat in silence almost all\\nthe way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever\\nvoluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\\nof delight exclusively addressed to her sister.  To atone\\nfor this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession\\nof the post of civility which she had assigned herself,\\nbehaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,\\ntalked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\\nwhenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side\\ntreated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous\\non every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only\\ndisturbed that she could not make them choose their own\\ndinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\\npreferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.\\nThey reached town by three o\\'clock the third day, glad to\\nbe released, after such a journey, from the confinement\\nof a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\\n\\nThe house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,\\nand the young ladies were immediately put in possession\\nof a very comfortable apartment.  It had formerly\\nbeen Charlotte\\'s, and over the mantelpiece still hung\\na landscape in coloured silks of her performance,\\nin proof of her having spent seven years at a great school\\nin town to some effect.\\n\\nAs dinner was not to be ready in less than two\\nhours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ\\nthe interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for\\nthat purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did the same.\\n\"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?\"\\n\\n\"I am NOT going to write to my mother,\"\\nreplied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid\\nany farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it immediately\\nstruck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was,\\nthat, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\\nthe affair, they must be engaged.  This conviction,\\nthough not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,\\nand she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\\nMarianne\\'s was finished in a very few minutes;\\nin length it could be no more than a note; it was then\\nfolded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.\\nElinor thought she could distinguish a large W in\\nthe direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,\\nringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it\\nto get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.\\nThis decided the matter at once.\\n\\nHer spirits still continued very high; but there\\nwas a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\\npleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as\\nthe evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,\\nand when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,\\nseemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\\n\\nIt was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings,\\nby being much engaged in her own room, could see little\\nof what was passing.  The tea things were brought in,\\nand already had Marianne been disappointed more than once\\nby a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,\\nElinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby\\'s approach,\\nand Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.\\nEvery thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;\\nshe opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,\\nand after listening half a minute, returned into the room\\nin all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\\nhim would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her\\nfeelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,\\n\"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed\\nalmost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel\\nBrandon appeared.\\n\\nIt was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,\\nand she immediately left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too;\\nbut at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured\\nhis welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that\\na man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\\nexperienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.\\nShe instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,\\nthat he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,\\nwith such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him\\nthe recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\\n\\n\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\\n\\nElinor answered in some distress that she was,\\nand then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;\\nand of every thing to which she could decently attribute\\nher sister\\'s behaviour.\\n\\nHe heard her with the most earnest attention,\\nbut seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,\\nand began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\\nin London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,\\nand the friends they had left behind.\\n\\nIn this calm kind of way, with very little interest\\non either side, they continued to talk, both of them out\\nof spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.\\nElinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were\\nthen in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain\\nby any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way\\nof saying something, she asked if he had been in London\\never since she had seen him last.  \"Yes,\" he replied,\\nwith some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have been\\nonce or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never\\nbeen in my power to return to Barton.\"\\n\\nThis, and the manner in which it was said,\\nimmediately brought back to her remembrance all the\\ncircumstances of his quitting that place, with the\\nuneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,\\nand she was fearful that her question had implied\\nmuch more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she,\\nwith her usual noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad\\nto see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your\\npardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little,\\nand settle my matters; for it is a long while since I\\nhave been at home, and you know one has always a world\\nof little odd things to do after one has been away for\\nany time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--\\nLord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!\\nBut pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should\\nbe in town today?\"\\n\\n\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer\\'s,\\nwhere I have been dining.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their\\nhouse?  How does Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine\\nsize by this time.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned\\nto tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel,\\nI have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,\\nyou see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.\\nYour friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be\\nsorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby\\nwill do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing\\nto be young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I\\nnever was very handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got\\na very good husband, and I don\\'t know what the greatest\\nbeauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has been dead\\nthese eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have\\nyou been to since we parted?  And how does your business\\ngo on?  Come, come, let\\'s have no secrets among friends.\"\\n\\nHe replied with his accustomary mildness to all\\nher inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.\\nElinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was\\nobliged to appear again.\\n\\nAfter her entrance, Colonel Brandon became\\nmore thoughtful and silent than he had been before,\\nand Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.\\nNo other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies\\nwere unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\\n\\nMarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits\\nand happy looks.  The disappointment of the evening before\\nseemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\\nthat day.  They had not long finished their breakfast before\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s barouche stopped at the door, and in a few\\nminutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted\\nto see them all, that it was hard to say whether she\\nreceived most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss\\nDashwoods again.  So surprised at their coming to town,\\nthough it was what she had rather expected all along;\\nso angry at their accepting her mother\\'s invitation\\nafter having declined her own, though at the same time\\nshe would never have forgiven them if they had not come!\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\"\\nsaid she; \"What do you think he said when he heard\\nof your coming with Mamma?  I forget what it was now,\\nbut it was something so droll!\"\\n\\nAfter an hour or two spent in what her mother called\\ncomfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry\\nconcerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings\\'s side,\\nand in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer\\'s, it was\\nproposed by the latter that they should all accompany\\nher to some shops where she had business that morning,\\nto which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,\\nas having likewise some purchases to make themselves;\\nand Marianne, though declining it at first was induced\\nto go likewise.\\n\\nWherever they went, she was evidently always on\\nthe watch.  In Bond Street especially, where much of\\ntheir business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;\\nand in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was\\nequally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others.\\nRestless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could\\nnever obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,\\nhowever it might equally concern them both: she received\\nno pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\\nhome again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation\\nat the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught\\nby every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild\\nto buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\\ntime in rapture and indecision.\\n\\nIt was late in the morning before they returned home;\\nand no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew\\neagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found\\nher turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,\\nwhich declared that no Willoughby had been there.\\n\\n\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\"\\nsaid she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.\\nShe was answered in the negative.  \"Are you quite sure\\nof it?\" she replied.  \"Are you certain that no servant,\\nno porter has left any letter or note?\"\\n\\nThe man replied that none had.\\n\\n\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed\\nvoice, as she turned away to the window.\\n\\n\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself,\\nregarding her sister with uneasiness.  \"If she had not\\nknown him to be in town she would not have written to him,\\nas she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\\nand if he is in town, how odd that he should neither\\ncome nor write!  Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong\\nin permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,\\na man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,\\nso mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will MY\\ninterference be borne.\"\\n\\nShe determined, after some consideration, that if\\nappearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they\\nnow were, she would represent in the strongest manner\\nto her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the\\naffair.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nintimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited\\nin the morning, dined with them.  The former left them\\nsoon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;\\nand Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions,\\nas she would never learn the game; but though her time\\nwas therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no\\nmeans more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor,\\nfor it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the\\npain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured for a\\nfew minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,\\nand she returned to the more interesting employment\\nof walking backwards and forwards across the room,\\npausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,\\nin hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 27\\n\\n\\n\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nwhen they met at breakfast the following morning,\\n\"Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;\\n\\'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day\\'s pleasure.\\nPoor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem\\nto take it so much to heart.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice,\\nand walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.\\n\"I had not thought of that.  This weather will keep many\\nsportsmen in the country.\"\\n\\nIt was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were\\nrestored by it.  \"It is charming weather for THEM indeed,\"\\nshe continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table\\nwith a happy countenance.  \"How much they must enjoy\\nit! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot\\nbe expected to last long.  At this time of the year,\\nand after such a series of rain, we shall certainly\\nhave very little more of it.  Frosts will soon set in,\\nand in all probability with severity.  In another day\\nor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last\\nlonger--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\\n\\n\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent\\nMrs. Jennings from seeing her sister\\'s thoughts as clearly\\nas she did, \"I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady\\nMiddleton in town by the end of next week.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, my dear, I\\'ll warrant you we do.  Mary always\\nhas her own way.\"\\n\\n\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will\\nwrite to Combe by this day\\'s post.\"\\n\\nBut if she DID, the letter was written and sent away\\nwith a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain\\nthe fact.  Whatever the truth of it might be, and far\\nas Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,\\nyet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be\\nvery uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits;\\nhappy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier\\nin her expectation of a frost.\\n\\nThe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at\\nthe houses of Mrs. Jennings\\'s acquaintance to inform\\nthem of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time\\nbusy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the\\nvariations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning,\\nElinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.\\nI can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.  It was\\nnot so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem parting too,\\nthe sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\\nclear afternoon.\"\\n\\nElinor was alternately diverted and pained;\\nbut Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the\\nbrightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance\\nof the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be\\ndissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings\\'s style of living, and set\\nof acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,\\nwhich was invariably kind.  Every thing in her household\\narrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,\\nand excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s regret, she had never dropped, she visited\\nno one to whom an introduction could at all discompose\\nthe feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find\\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than\\nshe had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound\\nfor the want of much real enjoyment from any of their\\nevening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,\\nformed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, who had a general invitation\\nto the house, was with them almost every day; he came\\nto look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived\\nmore satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\\nother daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time\\nwith much concern his continued regard for her sister.\\nShe feared it was a strengthening regard.  It grieved her\\nto see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,\\nand his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.\\n\\nAbout a week after their arrival, it became\\ncertain that Willoughby was also arrived.  His card\\nwas on the table when they came in from the morning\\'s drive.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while\\nwe were out.\"  Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his\\nbeing in London, now ventured to say, \"Depend upon it,\\nhe will call again tomorrow.\"  But Marianne seemed\\nhardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning\\'s entrance,\\nescaped with the precious card.\\n\\nThis event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,\\nrestored to those of her sister all, and more than all,\\ntheir former agitation.  From this moment her mind was\\nnever quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour\\nof the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted\\non being left behind, the next morning, when the others\\nwent out.\\n\\nElinor\\'s thoughts were full of what might be passing\\nin Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment\\'s\\nglance at her sister when they returned was enough to\\ninform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.\\nA note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,\\n\\n\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"\\n\\nBut Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\\n\\n\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\\n\\n\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor,\\nunable to be longer silent.\\n\\n\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause.  \"You have no confidence\\nin me, Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have\\nconfidence in no one!\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,\\nMarianne, I have nothing to tell.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations\\nthen are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;\\nyou, because you do not communicate, and I, because\\nI conceal nothing.\"\\n\\nElinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,\\nwhich she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,\\nunder such circumstances, to press for greater openness\\nin Marianne.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being\\ngiven her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,\\nannouncing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,\\nand requesting the company of her mother and cousins\\nthe following evening.  Business on Sir John\\'s part,\\nand a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling\\nin Berkeley Street.  The invitation was accepted;\\nbut when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as\\nit was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they\\nshould both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still\\nshe had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was\\nnot more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling\\nto run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\\n\\nElinor found, when the evening was over,\\nthat disposition is not materially altered by a change\\nof abode, for although scarcely settled in town,\\nSir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\\nyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was\\nan affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.\\nIn the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;\\nbut in London, where the reputation of elegance was more\\nimportant and less easily attained, it was risking too much\\nfor the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that\\nLady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,\\nwith two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former,\\nwhom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,\\nas he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\\nto his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,\\nthey received no mark of recognition on their entrance.\\nHe looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\\nwho they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from\\nthe other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance\\nround the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE\\nwas not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed\\nto receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been\\nassembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards\\nthe Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\\nin town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed\\nof their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\\nsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come.\\n\\n\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\\n\\n\"When do you go back again?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\\n\\nNever had Marianne been so unwilling to dance\\nin her life, as she was that evening, and never so much\\nfatigued by the exercise.  She complained of it\\nas they returned to Berkeley Street.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason\\nof all that very well; if a certain person who shall\\nbe nameless, had been there, you would not have been a\\nbit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty\\nof him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\\n\\n\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir\\nJohn met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"\\nMarianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.\\nImpatient in this situation to be doing something\\nthat might lead to her sister\\'s relief, Elinor resolved\\nto write the next morning to her mother, and hoped\\nby awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,\\nto procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;\\nand she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne\\nwas again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose\\nit to be to any other person.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by\\nherself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,\\nwhile Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious\\nfor conversation, walked from one window to the other,\\nor sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\\nElinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,\\nrelating all that had passed, her suspicions of\\nWilloughby\\'s inconstancy, urging her by every plea\\nof duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\\nof her real situation with respect to him.\\n\\nHer letter was scarcely finished, when a rap\\nforetold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.\\nMarianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated\\ncompany of any kind, left the room before he entered it.\\nHe looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he\\nhad somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some\\ntime without saying a word.  Elinor, persuaded that he\\nhad some communication to make in which her sister\\nwas concerned, impatiently expected its opening.\\nIt was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\\nof conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with\\nthe observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"\\nor \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\\non the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\\nsomething particular about her.  After a pause of several\\nminutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her\\nin a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate\\nher on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not\\nprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,\\nwas obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,\\nof asking what he meant?  He tried to smile as he replied,\\n\"your sister\\'s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally\\nknown.\"\\n\\n\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor,\\n\"for her own family do not know it.\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon,\\nI am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not\\nsupposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,\\nand their marriage is universally talked of.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard\\nit mentioned?\"\\n\\n\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others\\nwith whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,\\nand the Middletons.  But still I might not have believed it,\\nfor where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\\nbe convinced, it will always find something to support\\nits doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to\\nMr. Willoughby in your sister\\'s writing.  I came to inquire,\\nbut I was convinced before I could ask the question.\\nIs every thing finally settled?  Is it impossible to-?\\nBut I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.\\nExcuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong\\nin saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on\\nyour prudence I have the strongest dependence.  Tell me\\nthat it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,\\nthat in short concealment, if concealment be possible,\\nis all that remains.\"\\n\\nThese words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal\\nof his love for her sister, affected her very much.\\nShe was not immediately able to say anything, and even\\nwhen her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short\\ntime, on the answer it would be most proper to give.\\nThe real state of things between Willoughby and her sister\\nwas so little known to herself, that in endeavouring\\nto explain it, she might be as liable to say too much\\nas too little.  Yet as she was convinced that Marianne\\'s\\naffection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s success, whatever the event of that affection\\nmight be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\\nfrom censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,\\nafter some consideration, to say more than she really knew\\nor believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though\\nshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms\\non which they stood with each other, of their mutual\\naffection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence\\nshe was not astonished to hear.\\n\\nHe listened to her with silent attention, and on\\nher ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,\\nand after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister\\nI wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\\n\\nElinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\\nconversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\\nother points; she was left, on the contrary, with a\\nmelancholy impression of Colonel Brandon\\'s unhappiness,\\nand was prevented even from wishing it removed,\\nby her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 28\\n\\n\\nNothing occurred during the next three or four days,\\nto make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying\\nto her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.\\nThey were engaged about the end of that time to attend\\nLady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was\\nkept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;\\nand for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,\\ncareless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent\\nwhether she went or staid, prepared, without one look\\nof hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the\\ndrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s arrival, without once stirring from her seat,\\nor altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,\\nand insensible of her sister\\'s presence; and when at\\nlast they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them\\nat the door, she started as if she had forgotten that\\nany one was expected.\\n\\nThey arrived in due time at the place of destination,\\nand as soon as the string of carriages before them\\nwould allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their\\nnames announced from one landing-place to another in an\\naudible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\\nquite full of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had\\npaid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady\\nof the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,\\nand take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to\\nwhich their arrival must necessarily add.  After some time\\nspent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat\\ndown to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for\\nmoving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,\\nplaced themselves at no great distance from the table.\\n\\nThey had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor\\nperceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards\\nof them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable\\nlooking young woman.  She soon caught his eye, and he\\nimmediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,\\nor to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;\\nand then continued his discourse with the same lady.\\nElinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether\\nit could be unobserved by her.  At that moment she first\\nperceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with\\nsudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,\\nhad not her sister caught hold of her.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he\\nis there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot\\nI speak to him?\"\\n\\n\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do\\nnot betray what you feel to every body present.\\nPerhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\\n\\nThis however was more than she could believe herself;\\nand to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond\\nthe reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.  She sat\\nin an agony of impatience which affected every feature.\\n\\nAt last he turned round again, and regarded them both;\\nshe started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone\\nof affection, held out her hand to him.  He approached,\\nand addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,\\nas if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\\nobserve her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after\\nMrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.\\nElinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,\\nand was unable to say a word.  But the feelings of her sister\\nwere instantly expressed.  Her face was crimsoned over,\\nand she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,\\n\"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?\\nHave you not received my letters?  Will you not shake\\nhands with me?\"\\n\\nHe could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed\\npainful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.\\nDuring all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.\\nElinor watched his countenance and saw its expression\\nbecoming more tranquil.  After a moment\\'s pause, he spoke\\nwith calmness.\\n\\n\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley\\nStreet last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was\\nnot fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings\\nat home.  My card was not lost, I hope.\"\\n\\n\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne\\nin the wildest anxiety.  \"Here is some mistake I am\\nsure--some dreadful mistake.  What can be the meaning\\nof it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven\\'s sake tell me,\\nwhat is the matter?\"\\n\\nHe made no reply; his complexion changed and all his\\nembarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye\\nof the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,\\nhe felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered\\nhimself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had the pleasure\\nof receiving the information of your arrival in town,\\nwhich you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away\\nwith a slight bow and joined his friend.\\n\\nMarianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable\\nto stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every\\nmoment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the\\nobservation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.\\n\\n\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she\\ncould speak, \"and force him to come to me.  Tell him\\nI must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--\\nI cannot rest--I shall not have a moment\\'s peace till this\\nis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--\\nOh go to him this moment.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,\\nyou must wait.  This is not the place for explanations.\\nWait only till tomorrow.\"\\n\\nWith difficulty however could she prevent her\\nfrom following him herself; and to persuade her to check\\nher agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance\\nof composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy\\nand more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued\\nincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery\\nof her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.\\nIn a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the\\ndoor towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he\\nwas gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again\\nthat evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.\\nShe instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady\\nMiddleton to take them home, as she was too miserable\\nto stay a minute longer.\\n\\nLady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,\\non being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too\\npolite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,\\nand making over her cards to a friend, they departed\\nas soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word\\nwas spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.\\nMarianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even\\nfor tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,\\nthey could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn\\nrestored her a little to herself.  She was soon undressed\\nand in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,\\nher sister then left her, and while she waited the return\\nof Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over\\nthe past.\\n\\nThat some kind of engagement had subsisted\\nbetween Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,\\nand that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;\\nfor however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,\\nSHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake\\nor misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough\\nchange of sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation\\nwould have been still stronger than it was, had she\\nnot witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak\\na consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been\\nsporting with the affections of her sister from the first,\\nwithout any design that would bear investigation.\\nAbsence might have weakened his regard, and convenience\\nmight have determined him to overcome it, but that such\\na regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself\\nto doubt.\\n\\nAs for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting\\nmust already have given her, and on those still more\\nsevere which might await her in its probable consequence,\\nshe could not reflect without the deepest concern.\\nHer own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\\ncould ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be\\ndivided in future, her mind might be always supported.\\nBut every circumstance that could embitter such an evil\\nseemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne\\nin a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate\\nand irreconcilable rupture with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 29\\n\\n\\nBefore the house-maid had lit their fire the next day,\\nor the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning\\nin January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling\\nagainst one of the window-seats for the sake of all\\nthe little light she could command from it, and writing\\nas fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.\\nIn this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation\\nand sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her\\nfor a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone\\nof the most considerate gentleness,\\n\\n\"Marianne, may I ask-?\"\\n\\n\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will\\nsoon know all.\"\\n\\nThe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said,\\nlasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately\\nfollowed by a return of the same excessive affliction.\\nIt was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,\\nand the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,\\nat intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her\\nfeeling how more than probable it was that she was writing\\nfor the last time to Willoughby.\\n\\nElinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention\\nin her power; and she would have tried to sooth and\\ntranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,\\nwith all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,\\nnot to speak to her for the world.  In such circumstances,\\nit was better for both that they should not be long together;\\nand the restless state of Marianne\\'s mind not only prevented\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,\\nbut requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,\\nmade her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding\\nthe sight of every body.\\n\\nAt breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat\\nany thing; and Elinor\\'s attention was then all employed,\\nnot in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing\\nto regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning\\'s\\nnotice entirely to herself.\\n\\nAs this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,\\nit lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting\\nthemselves, after it, round the common working table, when a\\nletter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught\\nfrom the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,\\ninstantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly\\nby this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must\\ncome from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness\\nat heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,\\nand sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it\\nimpossible to escape Mrs. Jenning\\'s notice.  That good lady,\\nhowever, saw only that Marianne had received a letter\\nfrom Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,\\nand which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,\\nthat she would find it to her liking.  Of Elinor\\'s distress,\\nshe was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted\\nfor her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing\\nher talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so\\ndesperately in love in my life!  MY girls were nothing\\nto her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as\\nfor Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.\\nI hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won\\'t keep her\\nwaiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her\\nlook so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when are they to be married?\"\\n\\nElinor, though never less disposed to speak than at\\nthat moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack\\nas this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, \"And have\\nyou really, Ma\\'am, talked yourself into a persuasion\\nof my sister\\'s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I thought\\nit had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems\\nto imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not\\ndeceive yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing\\nwould surprise me more than to hear of their being going\\nto be married.\"\\n\\n\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you\\ntalk so?  Don\\'t we all know that it must be a match, that\\nthey were over head and ears in love with each other from\\nthe first moment they met?  Did not I see them together\\nin Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose\\nto buy wedding clothes?  Come, come, this won\\'t do.\\nBecause you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody\\nelse has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you,\\nfor it has been known all over town this ever so long.\\nI tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously,\\n\"you are mistaken.  Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing\\nin spreading the report, and you will find that you have\\nthough you will not believe me now.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not\\nspirits to say more, and eager at all events to know\\nwhat Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,\\nwhere, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on\\nthe bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\\nand two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near,\\nbut without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,\\ntook her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,\\nand then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first\\nwas scarcely less violent than Marianne\\'s. The latter,\\nthough unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness\\nof this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in\\njoint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor\\'s hands;\\nand then covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nalmost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,\\nshocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,\\nwatched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\nspent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby\\'s letter,\\nread as follows:\\n\\n                              \"Bond Street, January.\\n     \"MY DEAR MADAM,\\n\\n     \"I have just had the honour of receiving your\\n     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere\\n     acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there\\n     was anything in my behaviour last night that did\\n     not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at\\n     a loss to discover in what point I could be so\\n     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your\\n     forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been\\n     perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on\\n     my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire\\n     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter\\n     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\n     misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your\\n     whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so\\n     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than\\n     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself\\n     for not having been more guarded in my professions\\n     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more\\n     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand\\n     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,\\n     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before\\n     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great\\n     regret that I obey your commands in returning the\\n     letters with which I have been honoured from you,\\n     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed\\n     on me.\\n\\n     \"I am, dear Madam,\\n               \"Your most obedient\\n                    \"humble servant,\\n                                        \"JOHN WILLOUGHBY.\"\\n\\n\\nWith what indignation such a letter as this must\\nbe read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware,\\nbefore she began it, that it must bring a confession\\nof his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever,\\nshe was not aware that such language could be suffered\\nto announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every\\nhonourable and delicate feeling--so far from the common\\ndecorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently\\ncruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire\\nof a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no\\nbreach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--\\na letter of which every line was an insult, and which\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.\\n\\nShe paused over it for some time with indignant\\nastonishment; then read it again and again; but every\\nperusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man,\\nand so bitter were her feelings against him, that she\\ndared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\\nMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,\\nnot as a loss to her of any possible good but as an\\nescape from the worst and most irremediable of all\\nevils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man,\\nas a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.\\n\\nIn her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter,\\non the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,\\nand probably, on the very different mind of a very different\\nperson, who had no other connection whatever with the affair\\nthan what her heart gave him with every thing that passed,\\nElinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister,\\nforgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread,\\nand so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room,\\nthat when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door,\\nshe went to the window to see who could be coming so\\nunreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s chariot, which she knew had not been\\nordered till one.  Determined not to quit Marianne,\\nthough hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease,\\nshe hurried away to excuse herself from attending\\nMrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed.\\nMrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern\\nfor its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor,\\nafter seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she\\nfound attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached\\njust in time to prevent her from falling on the floor,\\nfaint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;\\nfor it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\\nnights since she had really slept; and now, when her\\nmind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense,\\nthe consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,\\na weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness.\\nA glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,\\nmade her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express\\nsome sense of her kindness, by saying,\\n\\n\"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!\"\\n\\n\"I only wish,\" replied her sister, \"there were\\nany thing I COULD do, which might be of comfort to you.\"\\n\\nThis, as every thing else would have been,\\nwas too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim,\\nin the anguish of her heart, \"Oh! Elinor, I am miserable,\\nindeed,\" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\\n\\nElinor could no longer witness this torrent\\nof unresisted grief in silence.\\n\\n\"Exert yourself, dear Marianne,\" she cried,\\n\"if you would not kill yourself and all who love you.\\nThink of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer:\\nfor her sake you must exert yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot, I cannot,\" cried Marianne; \"leave me,\\nleave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!\\nbut do not torture me so.  Oh! how easy for those,\\nwho have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion!  Happy,\\nhappy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And\\ncan you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!\"\\n\\n\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" throwing her arms round\\nher sister\\'s neck; \"I know you feel for me; I know what\\na heart you have; but yet you are--you must be happy;\\nEdward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such happiness\\nas that?\"\\n\\n\"Many, many circumstances,\" said Elinor, solemnly.\\n\\n\"No, no, no,\" cried Marianne wildly, \"he loves you,\\nand only you.  You CAN have no grief.\"\\n\\n\"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.\"\\n\\n\"And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is\\na misery which nothing can do away.\"\\n\\n\"You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no\\ncomforts? no friends?  Is your loss such as leaves\\nno opening for consolation?  Much as you suffer now,\\nthink of what you would have suffered if the discovery\\nof his character had been delayed to a later period--\\nif your engagement had been carried on for months and months,\\nas it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it.\\nEvery additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side,\\nwould have made the blow more dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"Engagement!\" cried Marianne, \"there has been\\nno engagement.\"\\n\\n\"No engagement!\"\\n\\n\"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.\\nHe has broken no faith with me.\"\\n\\n\"But he told you that he loved you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied,\\nbut never professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it\\nhad been--but it never was.\"\\n\\n\"Yet you wrote to him?\"--\\n\\n\"Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?--\\nBut I cannot talk.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more, and turning again to the three\\nletters which now raised a much stronger curiosity\\nthan before, directly ran over the contents of all.\\nThe first, which was what her sister had sent him\\non their arrival in town, was to this effect.\\n\\n                         Berkeley Street, January.\\n\\n     \"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on\\n     receiving this; and I think you will feel something\\n     more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.\\n     An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.\\n     Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.\\n     I wish you may receive this in time to come here\\n     to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate\\n     I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.\\n\\n                                             \"M.D.\"\\n\\nHer second note, which had been written on the morning\\nafter the dance at the Middletons\\', was in these words:--\\n\\n     \"I cannot express my disappointment in having\\n     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment\\n     at not having received any answer to a note which\\n     I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting\\n     to hear from you, and still more to see you, every\\n     hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,\\n     and explain the reason of my having expected this\\n     in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,\\n     because we are generally out by one.  We were last\\n     night at Lady Middleton\\'s, where there was a dance.\\n     I have been told that you were asked to be of the\\n     party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much\\n     altered indeed since we parted, if that could be\\n     the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose\\n     this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your\\n     personal assurance of its being otherwise.\\n\\n                                            \"M.D.\"\\n\\nThe contents of her last note to him were these:--\\n\\n     \"What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your\\n     behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation\\n     of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure\\n     which our separation naturally produced, with the\\n     familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared\\n     to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse\\n     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than\\n     insulting; but though I have not yet been able to\\n     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,\\n     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of\\n     it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely\\n     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have\\n     lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,\\n     explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall\\n     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It\\n     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill\\n     of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that\\n     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that\\n     your regard for us all was insincere, that your\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let\\n     it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at\\n     present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish\\n     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be\\n     ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are\\n     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,\\n     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.\\n\\n                                             \"M.D.\"\\n\\nThat such letters, so full of affection and confidence,\\ncould have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby\\'s sake,\\nwould have been unwilling to believe.  But her condemnation\\nof him did not blind her to the impropriety of their\\nhaving been written at all; and she was silently grieving\\nover the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited\\nproofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,\\nand most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne,\\nperceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to\\nher that they contained nothing but what any one would\\nhave written in the same situation.\\n\\n\"I felt myself,\" she added, \"to be as solemnly\\nengaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant\\nhad bound us to each other.\"\\n\\n\"I can believe it,\" said Elinor; \"but unfortunately\\nhe did not feel the same.\"\\n\\n\"He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he\\nfelt it.  I know he did.  Whatever may have changed him now, (and\\nnothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done\\nit), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish.\\nThis lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up,\\nwas begged of me with the most earnest supplication.\\nHad you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice\\nat that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our\\nbeing together at Barton?  The morning that we parted\\ntoo!  When he told me that it might be many weeks before\\nwe met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?\"\\n\\nFor a moment or two she could say no more;\\nbut when this emotion had passed away, she added,\\nin a firmer tone,\\n\\n\"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he\\nhave been instigated?\"\\n\\n\"By all the world, rather than by his own heart.\\nI could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance\\nleagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe\\nhis nature capable of such cruelty.  This woman of whom he\\nwrites--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own\\ndear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous\\nto bely me.  Beyond you three, is there a creature\\nin the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil\\nthan Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?\"\\n\\nElinor would not contend, and only replied,\\n\"Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them\\nbe cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister,\\nby seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits.\\nIt is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists\\nsuch malevolence.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" cried Marianne, \"misery such as mine has\\nno pride.  I care not who knows that I am wretched.\\nThe triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world.\\nElinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and\\nindependent as they like--may resist insult, or return\\nmortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be\\nwretched--and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness\\nof it that can.\"\\n\\n\"But for my mother\\'s sake and mine--\"\\n\\n\"I would do more than for my own.  But to appear\\nhappy when I am so miserable--Oh! who can require it?\"\\n\\nAgain they were both silent.  Elinor was employed\\nin walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window,\\nfrom the window to the fire, without knowing that she\\nreceived warmth from one, or discerning objects through\\nthe other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,\\nwith her head leaning against one of its posts,\\nagain took up Willoughby\\'s letter, and, after shuddering\\nover every sentence, exclaimed--\\n\\n\"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this\\nbe yours!  Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor,\\nnothing can.  Whatever he might have heard against me--\\nought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to\\nhave told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing\\nmyself? \\'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\\nwhich you so obligingly bestowed on me\\'--That is unpardonable.\\nWilloughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?\\nOh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\"\\n\\n\"No, Marianne, in no possible way.\"\\n\\n\"And yet this woman--who knows what her art may\\nhave been?--how long it may have been premeditated,\\nand how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can\\nshe be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and\\nattractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one,\\nno one--he talked to me only of myself.\"\\n\\nAnother pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated,\\nand it ended thus.\\n\\n\"Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.\\nCan not we be gone to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow, Marianne!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for\\nWilloughby\\'s sake--and now who cares for me? Who regards me?\"\\n\\n\"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe\\nMrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of\\nthe commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot\\nstay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions\\nand remarks of all these people.  The Middletons and\\nPalmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity of such\\na woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!\"\\n\\nElinor advised her to lie down again, and for a\\nmoment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease;\\nand in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one\\nposture to another, till growing more and more hysterical,\\nher sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all,\\nand for some time was fearful of being constrained to call\\nfor assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she\\nwas at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from\\nthat time till Mrs. Jennings returned, she continued\\non the bed quiet and motionless.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 30\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return,\\nand without waiting to have her request of admittance answered,\\nopened the door and walked in with a look of real concern.\\n\\n\"How do you do my dear?\"--said she in a voice of great\\ncompassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without\\nattempting to answer.\\n\\n\"How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.--\\nNo wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married\\nvery soon--a good-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience\\nwith him.  Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago,\\nand she was told it by a particular friend of Miss\\nGrey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;\\nand I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I,\\nall I can say is, that if this be true, he has used\\na young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I\\nwish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.\\nAnd so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it.\\nI have no notion of men\\'s going on in this way; and if ever\\nI meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he\\nhas not had this many a day.  But there is one comfort,\\nmy dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man\\nin the world worth having; and with your pretty face\\nyou will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won\\'t\\ndisturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry\\nout at once and have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons\\nluckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her.\"\\n\\nShe then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room,\\nas if she supposed her young friend\\'s affliction could\\nbe increased by noise.\\n\\nMarianne, to the surprise of her sister,\\ndetermined on dining with them.  Elinor even advised\\nher against it.  But \"no, she would go down; she could\\nbear it very well, and the bustle about her would\\nbe less.\"  Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a\\nmoment by such a motive, though believing it hardly\\npossible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more;\\nand adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\\nwhile Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready\\nto assist her into the dining room as soon as they were\\nsummoned to it.\\n\\nWhen there, though looking most wretchedly,\\nshe ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected.\\nHad she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s well-meant but ill-judged attentions\\nto her, this calmness could not have been maintained;\\nbut not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction\\nof her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing\\nthat was passing before her.\\n\\nElinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings\\'s kindness,\\nthough its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes\\nalmost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments,\\nand returned her those civilities, which her sister could\\nnot make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw\\nthat Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing\\nwas due to her which might make her at all less so.\\nShe treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness\\nof a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\\nits holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,\\nwas to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house,\\nand to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.\\nHad not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,\\nseen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained\\nby Mrs. Jennings\\'s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,\\nby a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.\\nAs soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was\\nforced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could\\nstay no longer.  With a hasty exclamation of Misery,\\nand a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\\nup and hurried out of the room.\\n\\n\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone,\\n\"how it grieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is\\nnot gone away without finishing her wine!  And the dried\\ncherries too!  Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.\\nI am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would\\nsend all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest\\nthing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl\\nso ill!  But when there is plenty of money on one side,\\nand next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care\\nno more about such things!--\"\\n\\n\"The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--\\nis very rich?\"\\n\\n\"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see\\nher? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome.\\nI remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married\\na very wealthy man.  But the family are all rich together.\\nFifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won\\'t come\\nbefore it\\'s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.\\nNo wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!\\nWell, it don\\'t signify talking; but when a young man,\\nbe who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl,\\nand promises marriage, he has no business to fly off\\nfrom his word only because he grows poor, and a richer\\ngirl is ready to have him.  Why don\\'t he, in such a case,\\nsell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants,\\nand make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you,\\nMiss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters\\ncame round.  But that won\\'t do now-a-days; nothing in the\\nway of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of\\nthis age.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?\\nIs she said to be amiable?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever\\nheard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say\\nthis morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her,\\nthat she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry\\nto have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could\\nnever agree.\"--\\n\\n\"And who are the Ellisons?\"\\n\\n\"Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age\\nand may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has\\nmade!--What now,\" after pausing a moment--\"your poor sister\\nis gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself.\\nIs there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,\\nit seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we\\nshall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.\\nWhat shall we play at?  She hates whist I know; but is there\\nno round game she cares for?\"\\n\\n\"Dear ma\\'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.\\nMarianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again\\nthis evening.  I shall persuade her if I can to go\\nearly to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name\\nher own supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has\\nbeen looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two,\\nfor this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as\\nlong as that.  And so the letter that came today finished it!\\nPoor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,\\nI would not have joked her about it for all my money.\\nBut then you know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made\\nsure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and\\nyou know young people like to be laughed at about them.  Lord!\\nhow concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they\\nhear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have called\\nin Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.\\nBut I shall see them tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution\\nMrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby,\\nor making the slightest allusion to what has passed,\\nbefore my sister.  Their own good-nature must point out\\nto them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever\\nbe said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings\\nwill be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible\\nfor you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister,\\nI am sure I would not mention a word about it to her\\nfor the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.\\nNo more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are\\nall very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I\\ngive them a hint, as I certainly will.  For my part,\\nI think the less that is said about such things, the better,\\nthe sooner \\'tis blown over and forgot.  And what does\\ntalking ever do you know?\"\\n\\n\"In this affair it can only do harm; more so\\nperhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it\\nhas been attended by circumstances which, for the sake\\nof every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become\\nthe public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to\\nMr. Willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement\\nwith my sister.\"\\n\\n\"Law, my dear!  Don\\'t pretend to defend him.\\nNo positive engagement indeed! after taking her all\\nover Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they\\nwere to live in hereafter!\"\\n\\nElinor, for her sister\\'s sake, could not press the\\nsubject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her\\nfor Willoughby\\'s; since, though Marianne might lose much,\\nhe could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.\\nAfter a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,\\nwith all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, \\'tis a true saying about an ill-wind,\\nfor it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.\\nHe will have her at last; aye, that he will.  Mind me,\\nnow, if they an\\'t married by Mid-summer.  Lord! how he\\'ll\\nchuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.\\nIt will be all to one a better match for your sister.\\nTwo thousand a year without debt or drawback--except\\nthe little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;\\nbut she may be \\'prenticed out at a small cost, and then\\nwhat does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can\\ntell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place,\\nfull of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great\\ngarden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees\\nin the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!\\nLord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we\\nwere there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful\\nstew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,\\nin short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is\\nclose to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from\\nthe turnpike-road, so \\'tis never dull, for if you only\\ngo and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,\\nyou may see all the carriages that pass along.\\nOh! \\'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the village,\\nand the parsonage-house within a stone\\'s throw.\\nTo my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,\\nwhere they are forced to send three miles for their meat,\\nand have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.\\nWell, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.\\nOne shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.\\nIf we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor,\\n\"we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon.\"\\nAnd then rising, she went away to join Marianne,\\nwhom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning,\\nin silent misery, over the small remains of a fire,\\nwhich, till Elinor\\'s entrance, had been her only light.\\n\\n\"You had better leave me,\" was all the notice\\nthat her sister received from her.\\n\\n\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go\\nto bed.\" But this, from the momentary perverseness\\nof impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.\\nHer sister\\'s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\\nsoon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her\\nlay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,\\nin a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,\\nshe was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass,\\nfull of something, in her hand.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected\\nthat I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the\\nhouse that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it\\nfor your sister.  My poor husband! how fond he was of it!\\nWhenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said\\nit did him more good than any thing else in the world.\\nDo take it to your sister.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference\\nof the complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good\\nyou are!  But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,\\nalmost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much\\nservice to her as rest, if you will give me leave,\\nI will drink the wine myself.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been\\nfive minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;\\nand Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,\\nthat though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,\\nof little importance to her, its healing powers,\\non a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\non herself as on her sister.\\n\\nColonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea,\\nand by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,\\nElinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\\nnor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\\nwas already aware of what occasioned her absence.\\nMrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;\\nfor soon after his entrance, she walked across the room\\nto the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--\\n\"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows\\nnothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\\n\\nHe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her\\'s,\\nand, with a look which perfectly assured her of his\\ngood information, inquired after her sister.\\n\\n\"Marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"She has been\\nindisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I\\nheard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it\\nthan I could believe possible at first.\"\\n\\n\"What did you hear?\"\\n\\n\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short,\\nthat a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I\\ntell you?  If you know it already, as surely you must,\\nI may be spared.\"\\n\\n\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness,\\n\"Mr. Willoughby\\'s marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO\\nknow it all.  This seems to have been a day of general\\nelucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.\\nMr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"In a stationer\\'s shop in Pall Mall, where I\\nhad business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,\\nand one of them was giving the other an account of the\\nintended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,\\nthat it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name\\nof Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,\\nfirst caught my attention; and what followed was a positive\\nassertion that every thing was now finally settled\\nrespecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer\\nto be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters.\\nOne thing, especially, I remember, because it served\\nto identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony\\nwas over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat\\nin Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be\\nimpossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative\\nlady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop\\ntill they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I\\nhave been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey\\'s guardian.\"\\n\\n\"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey\\nhas fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,\\nwe may find an explanation.\"\\n\\n\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least\\nI think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice\\nwhich seemed to distrust itself, \"And your sister--\\nhow did she--\"\\n\\n\"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have\\nonly to hope that they may be proportionately short.\\nIt has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday,\\nI believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,\\nperhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and,\\nin some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed!  But\\nyour sister does not--I think you said so--she does\\nnot consider quite as you do?\"\\n\\n\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly\\nshe would still justify him if she could.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal\\nof the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,\\nthe subject was necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had\\nwatched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who\\nexpected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood\\'s communication,\\nin such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon\\'s side,\\nas might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope\\nand happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole\\nevening more serious and thoughtful than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 31\\n\\n\\nFrom a night of more sleep than she had expected,\\nMarianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\\nof misery in which she had closed her eyes.\\n\\nElinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\\nof what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had\\ngone through the subject again and again; and with the same\\nsteady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor\\'s side,\\nthe same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\\nMarianne\\'s, as before.  Sometimes she could believe\\nWilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,\\nand at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility\\nof acquitting him.  At one moment she was absolutely\\nindifferent to the observation of all the world, at another\\nshe would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\\ncould resist it with energy.  In one thing, however,\\nshe was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,\\nwhere it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,\\nand in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.\\nHer heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nentering into her sorrows with any compassion.\\n\\n\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;\\n\"she cannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;\\nher good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants\\nis gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\\n\\nElinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\\nto which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,\\nby the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too\\ngreat importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\\nstrong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.\\nLike half the rest of the world, if more than half there\\nbe that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent\\nabilities and an excellent disposition, was neither\\nreasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people\\nthe same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged\\nof their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\\non herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the\\nsisters were together in their own room after breakfast,\\nwhich sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower\\nin her estimation; because, through her own weakness,\\nit chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\\nthough Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse\\nof the utmost goodwill.\\n\\nWith a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance\\ngaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,\\nshe entered their room, saying,\\n\\n\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure\\nwill do you good.\"\\n\\nMarianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination\\nplaced before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness\\nand contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,\\nconvincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,\\nrushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,\\nby the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.\\nThe work of one moment was destroyed by the next.\\nThe hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,\\nwas before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment\\nwhich followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,\\nshe felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.\\n\\nThe cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within\\nher reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,\\ncould have expressed; and now she could reproach her\\nonly by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely\\nlost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,\\nshe withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.\\nBut the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,\\nbrought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.\\nHer mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying\\nas warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused\\nby Elinor\\'s application, to intreat from Marianne greater\\nopenness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness\\ntowards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such\\na conviction of their future happiness in each other,\\nthat she wept with agony through the whole of it.\\n\\nAll her impatience to be at home again now returned;\\nher mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through\\nthe very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,\\nand she was wildly urgent to be gone.  Elinor, unable herself\\nto determine whether it were better for Marianne to be\\nin London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\\nexcept of patience till their mother\\'s wishes could be known;\\nand at length she obtained her sister\\'s consent to wait\\nfor that knowledge.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she\\ncould not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able\\nto grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing\\nElinor\\'s offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\\nof the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of\\nthe pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,\\nby Marianne\\'s letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\\nany foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother\\nan account of what had passed, and entreat her directions\\nfor the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room\\non Mrs. Jennings\\'s going away, remained fixed at the table\\nwhere Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,\\ngrieving over her for the hardship of such a task,\\nand grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\\n\\nIn this manner they had continued about a quarter\\nof an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then\\nbear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.\\n\\n\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor.  \"So early too! I\\nthought we HAD been safe.\"\\n\\nMarianne moved to the window--\\n\\n\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation.\\n\"We are never safe from HIM.\"\\n\\n\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust to THAT,\" retreating to her own room.\\n\"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no\\nconscience in his intrusion on that of others.\"\\n\\nThe event proved her conjecture right, though it\\nwas founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon\\nDID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that\\nsolicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw\\nTHAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,\\ncould not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.\\n\\n\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he,\\nafter the first salutation, \"and she encouraged me\\nto come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,\\nbecause I thought it probable that I might find you alone,\\nwhich I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my\\nwish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe\\nit is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must\\nnot say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,\\nlasting conviction to your sister\\'s mind.  My regard for her,\\nfor yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,\\nby relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY\\nsincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being\\nuseful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours\\nhave been spent in convincing myself that I am right,\\nis there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?\"\\nHe stopped.\\n\\n\"I understand you,\" said Elinor.  \"You have something\\nto tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character\\nfarther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship\\nthat can be shewn Marianne.  MY gratitude will be insured\\nimmediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS\\nmust be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton\\nlast October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go\\nfarther back.  You will find me a very awkward narrator,\\nMiss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A short\\naccount of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it\\nSHALL be a short one.  On such a subject,\" sighing heavily,\\n\"can I have little temptation to be diffuse.\"\\n\\nHe stopt a moment for recollection, and then,\\nwith another sigh, went on.\\n\\n\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--\\n(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression\\non you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton\\nPark--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded\\nto a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,\\nyour sister Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have NOT forgotten it.\"\\nHe looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,\\n\\n\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality\\nof tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance\\nbetween them, as well in mind as person.  The same warmth\\nof heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.\\nThis lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from\\nher infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.\\nOur ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years\\nwe were playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the\\ntime when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,\\nas we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my\\npresent forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me\\nincapable of having ever felt.  Her\\'s, for me, was, I believe,\\nfervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\\nand it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.\\nAt seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was\\nmarried--married against her inclination to my brother.\\nHer fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\\nAnd this, I fear, is all that can be said for the\\nconduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\\nMy brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.\\nI had hoped that her regard for me would support her\\nunder any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at\\nlast the misery of her situation, for she experienced\\ngreat unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\\nshe had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I\\nrelate!  I have never told you how this was brought on.\\nWe were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.\\nThe treachery, or the folly, of my cousin\\'s maid betrayed us.\\nI was banished to the house of a relation far distant,\\nand she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\\ntill my father\\'s point was gained.  I had depended on her\\nfortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--\\nbut had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,\\na few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least\\nI should not have now to lament it.  This however\\nwas not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;\\nhis pleasures were not what they ought to have been,\\nand from the first he treated her unkindly.  The consequence\\nof this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced\\nas Mrs. Brandon\\'s, was but too natural.  She resigned\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation;\\nand happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we\\nwonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,\\nand without a friend to advise or restrain her (for\\nmy father lived only a few months after their marriage,\\nand I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\\nshould fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I\\nmeant to promote the happiness of both by removing\\nfrom her for years, and for that purpose had procured\\nmy exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\\nhe continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of\\ntrifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,\\nabout two years afterwards, of her divorce.  It was\\nTHAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection\\nof what I suffered--\"\\n\\nHe could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few\\nminutes about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,\\nand still more by his distress, could not speak.  He saw\\nher concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,\\nand kissed it with grateful respect.  A few minutes more\\nof silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\\n\\n\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy\\nperiod before I returned to England.  My first care,\\nwhen I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;\\nbut the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.\\nI could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there\\nwas every reason to fear that she had removed from him\\nonly to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance\\nwas not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her\\ncomfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that\\nthe power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he\\nimagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,\\nhad obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.\\nAt last, however, and after I had been six months in England,\\nI DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my own,\\nwho had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit\\nhim in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;\\nand there, the same house, under a similar confinement,\\nwas my unfortunate sister.  So altered--so faded--worn\\ndown by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I\\nbelieve the melancholy and sickly figure before me,\\nto be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\\non whom I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding\\nher--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\\nto describe it--I have pained you too much already.\\nThat she was, to all appearance, in the last stage\\nof a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\\nmy greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her,\\nbeyond giving time for a better preparation for death;\\nand that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,\\nand under proper attendants; I visited her every day\\nduring the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\\nlast moments.\"\\n\\nAgain he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor\\nspoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,\\nat the fate of his unfortunate friend.\\n\\n\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he,\\n\"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my\\npoor disgraced relation.  Their fates, their fortunes,\\ncannot be the same; and had the natural sweet\\ndisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,\\nor a happier marriage, she might have been all that you\\nwill live to see the other be.  But to what does all this\\nlead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.\\nAh! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched\\nfor fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!\\nI WILL be more collected--more concise.  She left to my care\\nher only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first\\nguilty connection, who was then about three years old.\\nShe loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\\nIt was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly\\nwould I have discharged it in the strictest sense,\\nby watching over her education myself, had the nature\\nof our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;\\nand my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.\\nI saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my\\nbrother, (which happened about five years ago, and which\\nleft to me the possession of the family property,) she\\nvisited me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;\\nbut I am well aware that I have in general been suspected\\nof a much nearer connection with her.  It is now three\\nyears ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)\\nthat I removed her from school, to place her under the care\\nof a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about\\nthe same time of life; and for two years I had every reason\\nto be pleased with her situation.  But last February,\\nalmost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.\\nI had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\\nout,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of\\nher young friends, who was attending her father there\\nfor his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,\\nand I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,\\nfor, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,\\nshe would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she\\ncertainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,\\nbut not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,\\ngive no information; for he had been generally confined\\nto the house, while the girls were ranging over the town\\nand making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried\\nto convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,\\nof his daughter\\'s being entirely unconcerned in the business.\\nIn short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;\\nall the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.\\nWhat I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I\\nsuffered too.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could\\nWilloughby!\"--\\n\\n\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued,\\n\"came in a letter from herself, last October.\\nIt was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it\\non the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;\\nand this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\\nwhich I am sure must at the time have appeared strange\\nto every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.\\nLittle did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his\\nlooks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,\\nthat I was called away to the relief of one whom he\\nhad made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,\\nwhat would it have availed?  Would he have been less\\ngay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,\\nhe had already done that, which no man who CAN feel\\nfor another would do.  He had left the girl whose\\nyouth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of\\nthe utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,\\nno friends, ignorant of his address!  He had left her,\\npromising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,\\nnor relieved her.\"\\n\\n\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.\\n\\n\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,\\nand worse than both.  Knowing all this, as I have now\\nknown it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing\\nyour sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured\\nthat she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\\nfor all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and\\nfound you alone, I came determined to know the truth;\\nthough irresolute what to do when it WAS known.\\nMy behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;\\nbut now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be\\nso deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?\\nI had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes\\nI thought your sister\\'s influence might yet reclaim him.\\nBut now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\\nwere his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been,\\nhowever, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL\\nturn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she\\ncompares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers\\nthe wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,\\nand pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,\\nstill as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented\\nby self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\\nSurely this comparison must have its use with her.\\nShe will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They\\nproceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.\\nOn the contrary, every friend must be made still more\\nher friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,\\nand respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\\nevery attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,\\nin communicating to her what I have told you.  You must\\nknow best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,\\nand from my heart believed it might be of service,\\nmight lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered\\nmyself to trouble you with this account of my family\\nafflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been\\nintended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s thanks followed this speech with grateful\\nearnestness; attended too with the assurance of her\\nexpecting material advantage to Marianne, from the\\ncommunication of what had passed.\\n\\n\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her\\nendeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it\\nirritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction\\nof his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first she\\nwill suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.\\nHave you,\" she continued, after a short silence,\\n\"ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have.  One meeting\\nwas unavoidable.\"\\n\\nElinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously,\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"What? have you met him to--\"\\n\\n\"I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed\\nto me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;\\nand when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight\\nafter myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,\\nI to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded,\\nand the meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"\\n\\nElinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this;\\nbut to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.\\n\\n\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause,\\n\"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother\\nand daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"\\n\\n\"Is she still in town?\"\\n\\n\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,\\nfor I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her\\nchild into the country, and there she remains.\"\\n\\nRecollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably\\ndividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,\\nreceiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,\\nand leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 32\\n\\n\\nWhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated\\nby Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,\\nthe effect on her was not entirely such as the former\\nhad hoped to see.  Not that Marianne appeared to distrust\\nthe truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all\\nwith the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\\nobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,\\nand seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to\\nbe impossible.  But though this behaviour assured Elinor\\nthat the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to\\nher mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,\\nin her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,\\nin her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,\\nwith a kind of compassionate respect, and though she\\nsaw her spirits less violently irritated than before,\\nshe did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did become\\nsettled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\\nShe felt the loss of Willoughby\\'s character yet more heavily\\nthan she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and\\ndesertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,\\nand the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been\\non herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\\neven to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,\\ngave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\\nby the most open and most frequent confession of them.\\n\\nTo give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood\\non receiving and answering Elinor\\'s letter would be only\\nto give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt\\nand said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than\\nMarianne\\'s, and an indignation even greater than Elinor\\'s.\\nLong letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;\\nto express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat\\nshe would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.\\nBad indeed must the nature of Marianne\\'s affliction be,\\nwhen her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying\\nand humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,\\nwhich SHE could wish her not to indulge!\\n\\nAgainst the interest of her own individual comfort,\\nMrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for\\nMarianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton,\\nwhere every thing within her view would be bringing back\\nthe past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,\\nby constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as\\nshe had always seen him there.  She recommended it to\\nher daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their\\nvisit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never\\nexactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least\\nfive or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects,\\nand of company, which could not be procured at Barton,\\nwould be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,\\ncheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,\\nand even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both\\nmight now be spurned by her.\\n\\nFrom all danger of seeing Willoughby again,\\nher mother considered her to be at least equally safe\\nin town as in the country, since his acquaintance must\\nnow be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.\\nDesign could never bring them in each other\\'s way:\\nnegligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise;\\nand chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London\\nthan even in the retirement of Barton, where it might\\nforce him before her while paying that visit at Allenham\\non his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\\nfirst as a probable event, had brought herself to expect\\nas a certain one.\\n\\nShe had yet another reason for wishing her children\\nto remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law\\nhad told her that he and his wife were to be in town\\nbefore the middle of February, and she judged it right\\nthat they should sometimes see their brother.\\n\\nMarianne had promised to be guided by her mother\\'s opinion,\\nand she submitted to it therefore without opposition,\\nthough it proved perfectly different from what she wished\\nand expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,\\nformed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her\\nlonger continuance in London it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal\\nsympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and\\nsuch scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment\\'s rest.\\n\\nBut it was a matter of great consolation to her,\\nthat what brought evil to herself would bring good to\\nher sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that\\nit would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely,\\ncomforted herself by thinking, that though their longer\\nstay would therefore militate against her own happiness,\\nit would be better for Marianne than an immediate return\\ninto Devonshire.\\n\\nHer carefulness in guarding her sister from ever\\nhearing Willoughby\\'s name mentioned, was not thrown away.\\nMarianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all\\nits advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John,\\nnor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\\nElinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended\\ntowards herself, but that was impossible, and she was\\nobliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.\\n\\nSir John, could not have thought it possible.\\n\"A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well!\\nSuch a good-natured fellow!  He did not believe there was a\\nbolder rider in England!  It was an unaccountable business.\\nHe wished him at the devil with all his heart.  He would\\nnot speak another word to him, meet him where he might,\\nfor all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side\\nof Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two\\nhours together.  Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such\\na deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they met\\nthat he had offered him one of Folly\\'s puppies! and this\\nwas the end of it!\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.\\n\"She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately,\\nand she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted\\nwith him at all.  She wished with all her heart Combe\\nMagna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated\\nhim so much that she was resolved never to mention\\nhis name again, and she should tell everybody she saw,\\nhow good-for-nothing he was.\"\\n\\nThe rest of Mrs. Palmer\\'s sympathy was shewn in procuring\\nall the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage,\\nand communicating them to Elinor.  She could soon tell\\nat what coachmaker\\'s the new carriage was building,\\nby what painter Mr. Willoughby\\'s portrait was drawn,\\nand at what warehouse Miss Grey\\'s clothes might be seen.\\n\\nThe calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton\\non the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor\\'s spirits,\\noppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness\\nof the others.  It was a great comfort to her to be sure\\nof exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their\\ncircle of friends: a great comfort to know that there\\nwas ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity\\nafter particulars, or any anxiety for her sister\\'s health.\\n\\nEvery qualification is raised at times, by the\\ncircumstances of the moment, to more than its real value;\\nand she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence\\nto rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort\\nthan good-nature.\\n\\nLady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair\\nabout once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred\\nvery often, by saying, \"It is very shocking, indeed!\"\\nand by the means of this continual though gentle vent,\\nwas able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the\\nfirst without the smallest emotion, but very soon\\nto see them without recollecting a word of the matter;\\nand having thus supported the dignity of her own sex,\\nand spoken her decided censure of what was wrong\\nin the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend\\nto the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore\\ndetermined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John)\\nthat as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance\\nand fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries\\nwere never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly\\nearned the privilege of intimate discussion of her\\nsister\\'s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always\\nconversed with confidence.  His chief reward for the\\npainful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present\\nhumiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which\\nMarianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness\\nof her voice whenever (though it did not often happen)\\nshe was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.\\nTHESE assured him that his exertion had produced an\\nincrease of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave\\nElinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;\\nbut Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew\\nonly that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that\\nshe could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself,\\nnor commission her to make it for him, began, at the\\nend of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer,\\nthey would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the\\nend of a week that it would not be a match at all.\\nThe good understanding between the Colonel and Miss\\nDashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours\\nof the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,\\nwould all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had,\\nfor some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\nEarly in February, within a fortnight from the\\nreceipt of Willoughby\\'s letter, Elinor had the painful\\noffice of informing her sister that he was married.\\nShe had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed\\nto herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony\\nwas over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not\\nreceive the first notice of it from the public papers,\\nwhich she saw her eagerly examining every morning.\\n\\nShe received the news with resolute composure;\\nmade no observation on it, and at first shed no tears;\\nbut after a short time they would burst out, and for the\\nrest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable\\nthan when she first learnt to expect the event.\\n\\nThe Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married;\\nand Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger\\nof her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister,\\nwho had never yet left the house since the blow first fell,\\nto go out again by degrees as she had done before.\\n\\nAbout this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived\\nat their cousin\\'s house in Bartlett\\'s Buildings,\\nHolburn, presented themselves again before their more\\ngrand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets;\\nand were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\\n\\nElinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence\\nalways gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make\\na very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy\\nin finding her STILL in town.\\n\\n\"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not\\nfound you here STILL,\" said she repeatedly, with a strong\\nemphasis on the word.  \"But I always thought I SHOULD.\\nI was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile;\\nthough you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should\\nnot stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time,\\nthat you would most likely change your mind when it came\\nto the point.  It would have been such a great pity\\nto have went away before your brother and sister came.\\nAnd now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.\\nI am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.\"\\n\\nElinor perfectly understood her, and was forced\\nto use all her self-command to make it appear that she\\ndid NOT.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did\\nyou travel?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the stage, I assure you,\" replied Miss Steele,\\nwith quick exultation; \"we came post all the way, and had\\na very smart beau to attend us.  Dr. Davies was coming\\nto town, and so we thought we\\'d join him in a post-chaise;\\nand he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve\\nshillings more than we did.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"very pretty,\\nindeed! and the Doctor is a single man, I warrant you.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering,\\n\"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I\\ncannot think why.  My cousins say they are sure I have\\nmade a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think\\nabout him from one hour\\'s end to another.  \\'Lord! here\\ncomes your beau, Nancy,\\' my cousin said t\\'other day,\\nwhen she saw him crossing the street to the house.\\nMy beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you mean.\\nThe Doctor is no beau of mine.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won\\'t do--\\nthe Doctor is the man, I see.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed!\" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness,\\n\"and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked\\nof.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying\\nassurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele\\nwas made completely happy.\\n\\n\"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother\\nand sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town,\"\\nsaid Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints,\\nto the charge.\\n\\n\"No, I do not think we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I dare say you will.\"\\n\\nElinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\\n\\n\"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can\\nspare you both for so long a time together!\"\\n\\n\"Long a time, indeed!\" interposed Mrs. Jennings.\\n\"Why, their visit is but just begun!\"\\n\\nLucy was silenced.\\n\\n\"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\"\\nsaid Miss Steele.  \"I am sorry she is not well--\"\\nfor Marianne had left the room on their arrival.\\n\\n\"You are very good.  My sister will be equally\\nsorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has\\nbeen very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches,\\nwhich make her unfit for company or conversation.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old\\nfriends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US;\\nand I am sure we would not speak a word.\"\\n\\nElinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.\\nHer sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her\\ndressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.\\n\\n\"Oh, if that\\'s all,\" cried Miss Steele, \"we can\\njust as well go and see HER.\"\\n\\nElinor began to find this impertinence too much for\\nher temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it,\\nby Lucy\\'s sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions,\\nthough it did not give much sweetness to the manners\\nof one sister, was of advantage in governing those of\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 33\\n\\n\\nAfter some opposition, Marianne yielded to her\\nsister\\'s entreaties, and consented to go out with her\\nand Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour. She\\nexpressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits,\\nand would do no more than accompany them to Gray\\'s in\\nSackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation\\nfor the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\\n\\nWhen they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected\\nthat there was a lady at the other end of the street\\non whom she ought to call; and as she had no business\\nat Gray\\'s, it was resolved, that while her young friends\\ntransacted their\\'s, she should pay her visit and\\nreturn for them.\\n\\nOn ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found\\nso many people before them in the room, that there was\\nnot a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they\\nwere obliged to wait.  All that could be done was, to sit\\ndown at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\\nquickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there,\\nand it is probable that Elinor was not without hope\\nof exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.\\nBut the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy\\nof his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.\\nHe was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself,\\nand till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined,\\nall of which, after examining and debating for a quarter\\nof an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,\\nwere finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had\\nno leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies,\\nthan what was comprised in three or four very broad stares;\\na kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor\\nthe remembrance of a person and face, of strong,\\nnatural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in\\nthe first style of fashion.\\n\\nMarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings\\nof contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination\\nof their features, and on the puppyism of his manner\\nin deciding on all the different horrors of the different\\ntoothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining\\nunconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\\nher thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was\\npassing around her, in Mr. Gray\\'s shop, as in her own bedroom.\\n\\nAt last the affair was decided.  The ivory,\\nthe gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment,\\nand the gentleman having named the last day on which his\\nexistence could be continued without the possession of the\\ntoothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care,\\nand bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such\\na one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration,\\nwalked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected\\nindifference.\\n\\nElinor lost no time in bringing her business forward,\\nwas on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman\\npresented himself at her side.  She turned her eyes towards\\nhis face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.\\n\\nTheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough\\nto make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray\\'s shop.\\nJohn Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see\\nhis sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction;\\nand his inquiries after their mother were respectful\\nand attentive.\\n\\nElinor found that he and Fanny had been in town\\ntwo days.\\n\\n\"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\"\\nsaid he, \"but it was impossible, for we were obliged\\nto take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange;\\nand we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.\\nHarry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended\\nto call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour,\\nbut one has always so much to do on first coming to town.\\nI am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal.  But tomorrow I\\nthink I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street,\\nand be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.\\nI understand she is a woman of very good fortune.\\nAnd the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM.\\nAs my mother-in-law\\'s relations, I shall be happy to show\\nthem every respect.  They are excellent neighbours to you in\\nthe country, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort,\\ntheir friendliness in every particular, is more than I\\ncan express.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word;\\nextremely glad indeed.  But so it ought to be; they are\\npeople of large fortune, they are related to you, and\\nevery civility and accommodation that can serve to make\\nyour situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.\\nAnd so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage\\nand want for nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming\\naccount of the place: the most complete thing of its kind,\\nhe said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond\\nany thing.  It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it,\\nI assure you.\"\\n\\nElinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother;\\nand was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him,\\nby the arrival of Mrs. Jennings\\'s servant, who came to tell\\nher that his mistress waited for them at the door.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced\\nto Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating\\nhis hope of being able to call on them the next day,\\ntook leave.\\n\\nHis visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at\\nan apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;\\n\"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really\\nshe had no leisure for going any where.\"  Mrs. Jennings,\\nhowever, assured him directly, that she should not stand\\nupon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something\\nlike it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John\\nDashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.\\nHis manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind;\\nto Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a\\ncuriosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know\\nhim to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.\\n\\nAfter staying with them half an hour, he asked\\nElinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce\\nhim to Sir John and Lady Middleton.  The weather was\\nremarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon\\nas they were out of the house, his enquiries began.\\n\\n\"Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man;\\nand I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect\\nof a very respectable establishment in life.\"\\n\\n\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am\\nconvinced of it.  What is the amount of his fortune?\"\\n\\n\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\\n\\n\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself\\nup to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,\\n\"Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much,\\nfor your sake.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am\\nvery sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish\\nof marrying ME.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.\\nA very little trouble on your side secures him.\\nPerhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness\\nof your fortune may make him hang back; his friends\\nmay all advise him against it.  But some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\\ngive will fix him, in spite of himself.  And there can be\\nno reason why you should not try for him.  It is not to be\\nsupposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,\\nyou know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\\nout of the question, the objections are insurmountable--\\nyou have too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon\\nmust be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on\\nmy part to make him pleased with you and your family.\\nIt is a match that must give universal satisfaction.\\nIn short, it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice\\nto an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome\\nto ALL PARTIES.\" Recollecting himself, however, he added,\\n\"That is, I mean to say--your friends are all truly\\nanxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly,\\nfor she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.\\nAnd her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,\\nI am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\\nthe other day.\"\\n\\nElinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\\n\\n\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued,\\n\"something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I\\na sister settling at the same time.  And yet it is not\\nvery unlikely.\"\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution,\\n\"going to be married?\"\\n\\n\"It is not actually settled, but there is such\\na thing in agitation.  He has a most excellent mother.\\nMrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,\\nand settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\\ntakes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\\nof the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.\\nA very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not\\na doubt of its taking place in time.  A thousand a-year\\nis a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over\\nfor ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give\\nyou another instance of her liberality:--The other day,\\nas soon as we came to town, aware that money could\\nnot be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes\\ninto Fanny\\'s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.\\nAnd extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\\nexpense while we are here.\"\\n\\nHe paused for her assent and compassion; and she\\nforced herself to say,\\n\\n\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly\\nbe considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\\n\\n\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.\\nI do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly\\na comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.\\nThe enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,\\nis a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little\\npurchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,\\nyou must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.\\nThe land was so very desirable for me in every respect,\\nso immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it\\nmy duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands.  A man must\\npay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal\\nof money.\"\\n\\n\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again,\\nthe next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the\\npurchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed;\\nfor the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not\\nhappened to have the necessary sum in my banker\\'s hands,\\nI must have sold out to very great loss.\"\\n\\nElinor could only smile.\\n\\n\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have\\nhad on first coming to Norland.  Our respected father,\\nas you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects\\nthat remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\\nto your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his\\ndoing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\\nown property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,\\nwe have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,\\nchina, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.\\nYou may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we\\nmust be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars\\'s\\nkindness is.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,\\nI hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\"\\nhe gravely replied; \"but however there is still a great\\ndeal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny\\'s\\ngreen-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden\\nmarked out.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\\n\\n\"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old\\nwalnut trees are all come down to make room for it.\\nIt will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,\\nand the flower-garden will slope down just before it,\\nand be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old\\nthorns that grew in patches over the brow.\"\\n\\nElinor kept her concern and her censure to herself;\\nand was very thankful that Marianne was not present,\\nto share the provocation.\\n\\nHaving now said enough to make his poverty clear,\\nand to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings\\nfor each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray\\'s\\nhis thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to\\ncongratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\n\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house,\\nher style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;\\nand it is an acquaintance that has not only been\\nof great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove\\nmaterially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is\\ncertainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it\\nspeaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all\\nprobability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--\\nShe must have a great deal to leave.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has\\nonly her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\\n\\n\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\\nher income.  Few people of common prudence will do THAT;\\nand whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.\"\\n\\n\"And do you not think it more likely that she\\nshould leave it to her daughters, than to us?\"\\n\\n\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married,\\nand therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her\\nremembering them farther.  Whereas, in my opinion, by her\\ntaking so much notice of you, and treating you in this\\nkind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her\\nfuture consideration, which a conscientious woman would\\nnot disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;\\nand she can hardly do all this, without being aware\\nof the expectation it raises.\"\\n\\n\"But she raises none in those most concerned.\\nIndeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity\\ncarries you too far.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself,\\n\"people have little, have very little in their power.\\nBut, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--\\nshe looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown\\nquite thin.  Is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint\\non her for several weeks.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life,\\nany thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!\\nHer\\'s has been a very short one!  She was as handsome a girl\\nlast September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract\\nthe man.  There was something in her style of beauty,\\nto please them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say\\nthat she would marry sooner and better than you did;\\nnot but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it\\nhappened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.\\nI question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth\\nmore than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,\\nand I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better.\\nDorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear\\nElinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;\\nand I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself\\namong the earliest and best pleased of your visitors.\"\\n\\nElinor tried very seriously to convince him that\\nthere was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon;\\nbut it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself\\nto be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking\\nan intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage\\nby every possible attention.  He had just compunction\\nenough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,\\nto be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should\\ndo a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,\\nor a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect.\\n\\nThey were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton\\nat home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.\\nAbundance of civilities passed on all sides.  Sir John\\nwas ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did\\nnot seem to know much about horses, he soon set him\\ndown as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton\\nsaw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his\\nacquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away\\ndelighted with both.\\n\\n\"I shall have a charming account to carry\\nto Fanny,\" said he, as he walked back with his sister.\\n\"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!  Such\\na woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.\\nAnd Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,\\nthough not so elegant as her daughter.  Your sister need\\nnot have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say\\nthe truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally;\\nfor we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man\\nwho had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and\\nMrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither\\nshe nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny\\nwould like to associate with.  But now I can carry her\\na most satisfactory account of both.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 34\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her\\nhusband\\'s judgment, that she waited the very next day\\nboth on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her\\nconfidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying,\\nby no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton,\\nshe found her one of the most charming women in the world!\\n\\nLady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.\\nThere was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides,\\nwhich mutually attracted them; and they sympathised\\nwith each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,\\nand a general want of understanding.\\n\\nThe same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John\\nDashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit\\nthe fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing\\nmore than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,\\nwho met her husband\\'s sisters without any affection,\\nand almost without having anything to say to them;\\nfor of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street,\\nshe sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\\n\\nElinor wanted very much to know, though she did\\nnot chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town;\\nbut nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily\\nto mention his name before her, till able to tell her\\nthat his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on,\\nor till her husband\\'s expectations on Colonel Brandon\\nwere answered; because she believed them still so very\\nmuch attached to each other, that they could not be too\\nsedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\\nThe intelligence however, which SHE would not give,\\nsoon flowed from another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly\\nto claim Elinor\\'s compassion on being unable to see Edward,\\nthough he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.\\nHe dared not come to Bartlett\\'s Buildings for fear\\nof detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,\\nwas not to be told, they could do nothing at present\\nbut write.\\n\\nEdward assured them himself of his being in town,\\nwithin a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.\\nTwice was his card found on the table, when they returned\\nfrom their morning\\'s engagements.  Elinor was pleased\\nthat he had called; and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted\\nwith the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit\\nof giving anything, they determined to give them--\\na dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\\ninvited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had\\ntaken a very good house for three months.  Their sisters\\nand Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood\\nwas careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad\\nto be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\\ncivilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.\\nThey were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party.  The expectation\\nof seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested\\nin the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward\\'s\\nmother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\\nto attend such an introduction, though she could now see\\nher with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,\\nher desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars,\\nher curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\\n\\nThe interest with which she thus anticipated the\\nparty, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully\\nthan pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles\\nwere also to be at it.\\n\\nSo well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton,\\nso agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,\\nthat though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her\\nsister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John\\nto ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street;\\nand it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\\nSteeles, as soon as the Dashwoods\\' invitation was known,\\nthat their visit should begin a few days before the party\\ntook place.\\n\\nTheir claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nas the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had\\nhad the care of her brother, might not have done much,\\nhowever, towards procuring them seats at her table;\\nbut as Lady Middleton\\'s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family,\\nto have a nearer view of their characters and her own\\ndifficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\\nto please them, had seldom been happier in her life,\\nthan she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood\\'s card.\\n\\nOn Elinor its effect was very different.  She began\\nimmediately to determine, that Edward who lived with\\nhis mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party\\ngiven by his sister; and to see him for the first time,\\nafter all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\\nknew how she could bear it!\\n\\nThese apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded\\nentirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.\\nThey were relieved however, not by her own recollection,\\nbut by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be\\ninflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\\nthat Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,\\nand even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\\nby persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\\naffection for herself, which he could not conceal when they\\nwere together.\\n\\nThe important Tuesday came that was to introduce\\nthe two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.\\n\\n\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they\\nwalked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived\\nso directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed\\nthe servant at the same time--\"There is nobody here but\\nyou, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.\\nGood gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all\\nmy happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\\n\\nElinor could have given her immediate relief\\nby suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton\\'s mother,\\nrather than her own, whom they were about to behold;\\nbut instead of doing that, she assured her, and with\\ngreat sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\\namazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,\\nhoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,\\neven to formality, in her figure, and serious,\\neven to sourness, in her aspect.  Her complexion was sallow;\\nand her features small, without beauty, and naturally\\nwithout expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow\\nhad rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,\\nby giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.\\nShe was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people\\nin general, she proportioned them to the number of\\nher ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\\nnot one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed\\nwith the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\\n\\nElinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.--\\nA few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it\\nwas not in Mrs. Ferrars\\' power to distress her by it now;--\\nand the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles,\\na difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,\\nonly amused her.  She could not but smile to see the graciousness\\nof both mother and daughter towards the very person--\\nfor Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\\nhad they known as much as she did, they would have been most\\nanxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively\\nno power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.\\nBut while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,\\nshe could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from\\nwhich it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions\\nwith which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance,\\nwithout thoroughly despising them all four.\\n\\nLucy was all exultation on being so honorably\\ndistinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed\\nabout Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.\\n\\nThe dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous,\\nand every thing bespoke the Mistress\\'s inclination\\nfor show, and the Master\\'s ability to support it.\\nIn spite of the improvements and additions which were\\nmaking to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being\\nobliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom\\nof that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--\\nno poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--\\nbut there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood\\nhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\\nand his wife had still less.  But there was no peculiar\\ndisgrace in this; for it was very much the case with\\nthe chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured\\nunder one or other of these disqualifications for being\\nagreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\\nof elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\\n\\nWhen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room\\nafter dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,\\nfor the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some\\nvariety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\\nand breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one\\nsubject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,\\nwhich was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,\\nand Lady Middleton\\'s second son William, who were nearly\\nof the same age.\\n\\nHad both the children been there, the affair might\\nhave been determined too easily by measuring them at once;\\nbut as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural\\nassertion on both sides; and every body had a right to\\nbe equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it\\nover and over again as often as they liked.\\n\\nThe parties stood thus:\\n\\nThe two mothers, though each really convinced that\\nher own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour\\nof the other.\\n\\nThe two grandmothers, with not less partiality,\\nbut more sincerity, were equally earnest in support\\nof their own descendant.\\n\\nLucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent\\nthan the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall\\nfor their age, and could not conceive that there could\\nbe the smallest difference in the world between them;\\nand Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,\\nas fast as she could, in favour of each.\\n\\nElinor, having once delivered her opinion on\\nWilliam\\'s side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and\\nFanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing\\nit by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called\\non for her\\'s, offended them all, by declaring that she\\nhad no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\\n\\nBefore her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted\\na very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law,\\nwhich being now just mounted and brought home,\\nornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,\\ncatching the eye of John Dashwood on his following\\nthe other gentlemen into the room, were officiously\\nhanded by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.\\n\\n\"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you,\\nas a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.\\nI do not know whether you have ever happened to see any\\nof her performances before, but she is in general reckoned\\nto draw extremely well.\"\\n\\nThe Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions\\nto connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he\\nwould have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood;\\nand on the curiosity of the others being of course excited,\\nthey were handed round for general inspection.\\nMrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor\\'s work,\\nparticularly requested to look at them; and after they had\\nreceived gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons\\'s approbation,\\nFanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing\\nher, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.\\n\\n\"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without\\nregarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.\\n\\nPerhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother\\nhad been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little,\\nshe immediately said,\\n\\n\"They are very pretty, ma\\'am--an\\'t they?\" But then again,\\nthe dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself,\\nprobably came over her, for she presently added,\\n\\n\"Do you not think they are something in Miss\\nMorton\\'s style of painting, Ma\\'am?--She DOES paint most\\ndelightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\\n\\n\"Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.\"\\n\\nMarianne could not bear this.--She was already\\ngreatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed\\npraise of another, at Elinor\\'s expense, though she\\nhad not any notion of what was principally meant by it,\\nprovoked her immediately to say with warmth,\\n\\n\"This is admiration of a very particular kind!--\\nwhat is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, or who cares,\\nfor her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, she took the screens out of her\\nsister-in-law\\'s hands, to admire them herself as they\\nought to be admired.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing\\nherself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort\\nthis bitter philippic, \"Miss Morton is Lord Morton\\'s daughter.\"\\n\\nFanny looked very angry too, and her husband was\\nall in a fright at his sister\\'s audacity.  Elinor was\\nmuch more hurt by Marianne\\'s warmth than she had been\\nby what produced it; but Colonel Brandon\\'s eyes, as they\\nwere fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only\\nwhat was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could\\nnot bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s feelings did not stop here.  The cold\\ninsolence of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister,\\nseemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses\\nto Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think\\nof with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment,\\nto her sister\\'s chair, and putting one arm round her neck,\\nand one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager,\\nvoice,\\n\\n\"Dear, dear Elinor, don\\'t mind them.  Don\\'t let them\\nmake YOU unhappy.\"\\n\\nShe could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome,\\nand hiding her face on Elinor\\'s shoulder, she burst\\ninto tears.  Every body\\'s attention was called, and almost\\nevery body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went\\nto them without knowing what he did.--Mrs. Jennings,\\nwith a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\\nher her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged\\nagainst the author of this nervous distress, that he\\ninstantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele,\\nand gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole\\nshocking affair.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered\\nenough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among\\nthe rest; though her spirits retained the impression\\nof what had passed, the whole evening.\\n\\n\"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon,\\nin a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,--\\n\"She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very\\nnervous,--she has not Elinor\\'s constitution;--and one must\\nallow that there is something very trying to a young woman\\nwho HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions.\\nYou would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably\\nhandsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--\\nNow you see it is all gone.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 35\\n\\n\\nElinor\\'s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.--\\nShe had found in her every thing that could tend to make\\na farther connection between the families undesirable.--\\nShe had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her\\ndetermined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all\\nthe difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement,\\nand retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been\\notherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful\\nfor her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her\\nfrom suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s creation,\\npreserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any\\nsolicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she did not\\nbring herself quite to rejoice in Edward\\'s being fettered\\nto Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable,\\nshe OUGHT to have rejoiced.\\n\\nShe wondered that Lucy\\'s spirits could be so very much\\nelevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest\\nand her vanity should so very much blind her as to make\\nthe attention which seemed only paid her because she was\\nNOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow\\nher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\\nbecause her real situation was unknown.  But that it was so,\\nhad not only been declared by Lucy\\'s eyes at the time,\\nbut was declared over again the next morning more openly,\\nfor at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down\\nin Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,\\nto tell her how happy she was.\\n\\nThe chance proved a lucky one, for a message from\\nMrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\\n\\n\"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were\\nby themselves, \"I come to talk to you of my happiness.\\nCould anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars\\'s way\\nof treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable as she\\nwas!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--\\nbut the very moment I was introduced, there was such an\\naffability in her behaviour as really should seem to say,\\nshe had quite took a fancy to me.  Now was not it so?--\\nYou saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?\"\\n\\n\"She was certainly very civil to you.\"\\n\\n\"Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--\\nI saw a vast deal more.  Such kindness as fell to the share\\nof nobody but me!--No pride, no hauteur, and your sister\\njust the same--all sweetness and affability!\"\\n\\nElinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still\\npressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness;\\nand Elinor was obliged to go on.--\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\"\\nsaid she, \"nothing could be more flattering than their\\ntreatment of you;--but as that was not the case\"--\\n\\n\"I guessed you would say so\"--replied Lucy\\nquickly--\"but there was no reason in the world why\\nMrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not,\\nand her liking me is every thing.  You shan\\'t talk me\\nout of my satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well,\\nand there will be no difficulties at all, to what I\\nused to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman,\\nand so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,\\nindeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable\\nMrs. Dashwood was!\"\\n\\nTo this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not\\nattempt any.\\n\\n\"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you\\ndon\\'t speak;--sure you an\\'t well.\"\\n\\n\"I never was in better health.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did\\nnot look it.  I should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have\\nbeen the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven\\nknows what I should have done without your friendship.\"--\\n\\nElinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting\\nher own success.  But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she\\ndirectly replied,\\n\\n\"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard\\nfor me, and next to Edward\\'s love, it is the greatest\\ncomfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one\\ngood thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often,\\nfor Lady Middleton\\'s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood,\\nso we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say,\\nand Edward spends half his time with his sister--besides,\\nLady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--\\nand Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\\nmore than once, they should always be glad to see me.--\\nThey are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you\\ntell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak\\ntoo high.\"\\n\\nBut Elinor would not give her any encouragement\\nto hope that she SHOULD tell her sister.  Lucy continued.\\n\\n\"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment,\\nif Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me.  If she had only\\nmade me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying\\na word, and never after had took any notice of me,\\nand never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know\\nwhat I mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding\\nsort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair.\\nI could not have stood it.  For where she DOES dislike,\\nI know it is most violent.\"\\n\\nElinor was prevented from making any reply to this\\ncivil triumph, by the door\\'s being thrown open, the servant\\'s\\nannouncing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward\\'s immediately walking in.\\n\\nIt was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each\\nshewed that it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish;\\nand Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk\\nout of the room again, as to advance farther into it.\\nThe very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form,\\nwhich they would each have been most anxious to avoid,\\nhad fallen on them.--They were not only all three together,\\nbut were together without the relief of any other person.\\nThe ladies recovered themselves first.  It was not Lucy\\'s\\nbusiness to put herself forward, and the appearance of\\nsecrecy must still be kept up.  She could therefore only\\nLOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,\\nsaid no more.\\n\\nBut Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she,\\nfor his sake and her own, to do it well, that she\\nforced herself, after a moment\\'s recollection,\\nto welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,\\nand almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\\nimproved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy,\\nnor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,\\nto deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,\\nand that she had very much regretted being from home,\\nwhen he called before in Berkeley Street.  She would\\nnot be frightened from paying him those attentions which,\\nas a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the\\nobservant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them\\nto be narrowly watching her.\\n\\nHer manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he\\nhad courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still\\nexceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case\\nrendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;\\nfor his heart had not the indifference of Lucy\\'s, nor\\ncould his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor\\'s.\\n\\nLucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined\\nto make no contribution to the comfort of the others,\\nand would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS\\nsaid, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer\\nall the information about her mother\\'s health, their coming\\nto town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\\nbut never did.\\n\\nHer exertions did not stop here; for she soon\\nafterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as\\nto determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne,\\nto leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\\nand THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away\\nseveral minutes on the landing-place, with the most\\nhigh-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.\\nWhen that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures\\nof Edward to cease; for Marianne\\'s joy hurried her into\\nthe drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him\\nwas like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,\\nand strongly spoken.  She met him with a hand that would\\nbe taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.\\n\\n\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great\\nhappiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?\"\\n\\nEdward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,\\nbut before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\\nreally felt.  Again they all sat down, and for a moment\\nor two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the\\nmost speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes\\nat Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each\\nother should be checked by Lucy\\'s unwelcome presence.\\nEdward was the first to speak, and it was to notice\\nMarianne\\'s altered looks, and express his fear of her\\nnot finding London agree with her.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t think of me!\" she replied with spirited\\nearnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears\\nas she spoke, \"don\\'t think of MY health.  Elinor is well,\\nyou see.  That must be enough for us both.\"\\n\\nThis remark was not calculated to make Edward or\\nElinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy,\\nwho looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.\\n\\n\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say\\nany thing that might introduce another subject.\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it,\\nbut I have found none.  The sight of you, Edward, is the\\nonly comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you\\nare what you always were!\"\\n\\nShe paused--no one spoke.\\n\\n\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must\\nemploy Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton.\\nIn a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust,\\nEdward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge.\"\\n\\nPoor Edward muttered something, but what it was,\\nnobody knew, not even himself.  But Marianne, who saw\\nhis agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever\\ncause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\\nand soon talked of something else.\\n\\n\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street\\nyesterday!  So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much\\nto say to you on that head, which cannot be said now.\"\\n\\nAnd with this admirable discretion did she defer\\nthe assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\\ndisagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly\\ndisgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.\\n\\n\"But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you\\nnot come?\"\\n\\n\"I was engaged elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends\\nwere to be met?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take\\nsome revenge on her, \"you think young men never stand\\nupon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them,\\nlittle as well as great.\"\\n\\nElinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely\\ninsensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,\\n\\n\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very\\nsure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.\\nAnd I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience\\nin the world; the most scrupulous in performing\\nevery engagement, however minute, and however it\\nmay make against his interest or pleasure.  He is the\\nmost fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,\\nand the most incapable of being selfish, of any body\\nI ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.\\nWhat! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you\\nmust be no friend of mine; for those who will accept\\nof my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.\"\\n\\nThe nature of her commendation, in the present case,\\nhowever, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the\\nfeelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very\\nunexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.\\n\\n\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward,\\nthis must not be.\"\\n\\nAnd drawing him a little aside, she whispered\\nher persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer.\\nBut even this encouragement failed, for he would go;\\nand Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours, soon afterwards went away.\\n\\n\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne,\\non her leaving them.  \"Could not she see that we wanted\\nher gone!--how teazing to Edward!\"\\n\\n\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been\\nthe longest known to him of any.  It is but natural\\nthat he should like to see her as well as ourselves.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know,\\nElinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.\\nIf you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,\\nas I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect\\nthat I am the last person in the world to do it.\\nI cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are\\nnot really wanted.\"\\n\\nShe then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow\\nher to say more, for bound as she was by her promise\\nof secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that\\nwould convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences\\nof her still continuing in an error might be, she was\\nobliged to submit to it.  All that she could hope, was\\nthat Edward would not often expose her or himself to the\\ndistress of hearing Marianne\\'s mistaken warmth, nor to the\\nrepetition of any other part of the pain that had attended\\ntheir recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 36\\n\\n\\nWithin a few days after this meeting, the newspapers\\nannounced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer,\\nEsq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very\\ninteresting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all\\nthose intimate connections who knew it before.\\n\\nThis event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings\\'s happiness,\\nproduced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time,\\nand influenced, in a like degree, the engagements\\nof her young friends; for as she wished to be as much\\nas possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning\\nas soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late\\nin the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular\\nrequest of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day,\\nin every day in Conduit Street.  For their own comfort\\nthey would much rather have remained, at least all\\nthe morning, in Mrs. Jennings\\'s house; but it was not\\na thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.\\nTheir hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton\\nand the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact\\nwas as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\\n\\nThey had too much sense to be desirable companions\\nto the former; and by the latter they were considered with\\na jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing\\nthe kindness which they wanted to monopolize.  Though nothing\\ncould be more polite than Lady Middleton\\'s behaviour to\\nElinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\\nBecause they neither flattered herself nor her children,\\nshe could not believe them good-natured; and because they\\nwere fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps\\nwithout exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;\\nbut THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use,\\nand easily given.\\n\\nTheir presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.\\nIt checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.\\nLady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them,\\nand the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of\\nand administer at other times, she feared they would despise\\nher for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed\\nof the three, by their presence; and it was in their power\\nto reconcile her to it entirely.  Would either of them\\nonly have given her a full and minute account of the whole\\naffair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would\\nhave thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice\\nof the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\\narrival occasioned.  But this conciliation was not granted;\\nfor though she often threw out expressions of pity for her\\nsister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection\\non the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect\\nwas produced, but a look of indifference from the former,\\nor of disgust in the latter.  An effort even yet lighter\\nmight have made her their friend.  Would they only have\\nlaughed at her about the Doctor!  But so little were they,\\nanymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,\\nthat if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole\\nday without hearing any other raillery on the subject,\\nthan what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.\\n\\nAll these jealousies and discontents, however, were so\\ntotally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought\\nit a delightful thing for the girls to be together;\\nand generally congratulated her young friends every night,\\non having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.\\nShe joined them sometimes at Sir John\\'s, sometimes\\nat her own house; but wherever it was, she always came\\nin excellent spirits, full of delight and importance,\\nattributing Charlotte\\'s well doing to her own care, and ready\\nto give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,\\nas only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\\nOne thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her\\ndaily complaint.  Mr. Palmer maintained the common,\\nbut unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;\\nand though she could plainly perceive, at different times,\\nthe most striking resemblance between this baby and every\\none of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing\\nhis father of it; no persuading him to believe that it\\nwas not exactly like every other baby of the same age;\\nnor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\\nproposition of its being the finest child in the world.\\n\\nI come now to the relation of a misfortune,\\nwhich about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.\\nIt so happened that while her two sisters with\\nMrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,\\nanother of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance\\nin itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.\\nBut while the imaginations of other people will carry\\nthem away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,\\nand to decide on it by slight appearances, one\\'s happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.\\nIn the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed\\nher fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,\\nthat on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,\\nand understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood\\'s sisters,\\nshe immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;\\nand this misconstruction produced within a day\\nor two afterwards, cards of invitation for them\\nas well as for their brother and sister, to a small\\nmusical party at her house.  The consequence of which was,\\nthat Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only\\nto the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\\ncarriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,\\nmust be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\\nto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they\\nmight not expect to go out with her a second time?  The power\\nof disappointing them, it was true, must always be her\\'s.\\nBut that was not enough; for when people are determined\\non a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel\\ninjured by the expectation of any thing better from them.\\n\\nMarianne had now been brought by degrees, so much\\ninto the habit of going out every day, that it was become\\na matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:\\nand she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\\nevening\\'s engagement, though without expecting the smallest\\namusement from any, and very often without knowing,\\ntill the last moment, where it was to take her.\\n\\nTo her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\\nindifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,\\nduring the whole of her toilet, which it received from\\nMiss Steele in the first five minutes of their being\\ntogether, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute\\nobservation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,\\nand asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price\\nof every part of Marianne\\'s dress; could have guessed the\\nnumber of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\\nMarianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out\\nbefore they parted, how much her washing cost per week,\\nand how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\\nThe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,\\nwas generally concluded with a compliment, which\\nthough meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne\\nas the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing\\nan examination into the value and make of her gown,\\nthe colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,\\nshe was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word\\nshe looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would\\nmake a great many conquests.\"\\n\\nWith such encouragement as this, was she dismissed\\non the present occasion, to her brother\\'s carriage;\\nwhich they were ready to enter five minutes after it\\nstopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable\\nto their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\\nof her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay\\non their part that might inconvenience either herself\\nor her coachman.\\n\\nThe events of this evening were not very remarkable.\\nThe party, like other musical parties, comprehended a\\ngreat many people who had real taste for the performance,\\nand a great many more who had none at all; and the performers\\nthemselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\\nand that of their immediate friends, the first private\\nperformers in England.\\n\\nAs Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,\\nshe made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\\npianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even\\nby the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix\\nthem at pleasure on any other object in the room.  In one\\nof these excursive glances she perceived among a group\\nof young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture\\non toothpick-cases at Gray\\'s.  She perceived him soon\\nafterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly\\nto her brother; and had just determined to find out his\\nname from the latter, when they both came towards her,\\nand Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.\\n\\nHe addressed her with easy civility, and twisted\\nhis head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\\nwords could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb\\nshe had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had\\nit been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended\\nless on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest\\nrelations!  For then his brother\\'s bow must have given\\nthe finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother\\nand sister would have begun.  But while she wondered\\nat the difference of the two young men, she did not find\\nthat the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out\\nof all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.\\nWhy they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself\\nin the course of a quarter of an hour\\'s conversation;\\nfor, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\\nGAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing\\nin proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it\\nmuch less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune\\nof a private education; while he himself, though probably\\nwithout any particular, any material superiority\\nby nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\\n\\n\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more;\\nand so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving\\nabout it.  \\'My dear Madam,\\' I always say to her, \\'you must\\nmake yourself easy.  The evil is now irremediable,\\nand it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would\\nyou be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your\\nown judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,\\nat the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent\\nhim to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending\\nhim to Mr. Pratt\\'s, all this would have been prevented.\\'\\nThis is the way in which I always consider the matter,\\nand my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\\n\\nElinor would not oppose his opinion, because,\\nwhatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\\nof a public school, she could not think of Edward\\'s\\nabode in Mr. Pratt\\'s family, with any satisfaction.\\n\\n\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his\\nnext observation, \"in a cottage near Dawlish.\"\\n\\nElinor set him right as to its situation;\\nand it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\\ncould live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.\\nHe bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\\nspecies of house.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond\\nof a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much\\nelegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money\\nto spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,\\nwithin a short distance of London, where I might drive\\nmyself down at any time, and collect a few friends\\nabout me, and be happy.  I advise every body who is going\\nto build, to build a cottage.  My friend Lord Courtland\\ncame to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\\nand laid before me three different plans of Bonomi\\'s.\\nI was to decide on the best of them.  \\'My dear Courtland,\\'\\nsaid I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, \\'do not\\nadopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.\\'\\nAnd that I fancy, will be the end of it.\\n\\n\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,\\nno space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.\\nI was last month at my friend Elliott\\'s, near Dartford.\\nLady Elliott wished to give a dance.  \\'But how can it\\nbe done?\\' said she; \\'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it\\nis to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage\\nthat will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?\\'\\nI immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,\\nso I said, \\'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.\\nThe dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\\ncard-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library\\nmay be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the\\nsupper be set out in the saloon.\\'  Lady Elliott was delighted\\nwith the thought.  We measured the dining-room, and found\\nit would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair\\nwas arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact,\\nyou see, if people do but know how to set about it,\\nevery comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\\nas in the most spacious dwelling.\"\\n\\nElinor agreed to it all, for she did not think\\nhe deserved the compliment of rational opposition.\\n\\nAs John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\\neldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\\nany thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,\\nwhich he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,\\nwhen they got home.  The consideration of Mrs. Dennison\\'s\\nmistake,\\nin supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the\\npropriety of their being really invited to become such,\\nwhile Mrs. Jenning\\'s engagements kept her from home.\\nThe expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;\\nand it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\\nof his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\\ncomplete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.\\nFanny was startled at the proposal.\\n\\n\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she,\\n\"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day\\nwith her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.\\nYou know I am always ready to pay them any attention\\nin my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.\\nBut they are Lady Middleton\\'s visitors.  How can I ask them\\naway from her?\"\\n\\nHer husband, but with great humility, did not see\\nthe force of her objection.  \"They had already spent a week\\nin this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton\\ncould not be displeased at their giving the same number\\nof days to such near relations.\"\\n\\nFanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,\\n\\n\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it\\nwas in my power.  But I had just settled within myself\\nto ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.\\nThey are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think\\nthe attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\\nwell by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year,\\nyou know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.\\nI am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,\\nyou know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they\\nare such favourites with Harry!\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity\\nof inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience\\nwas pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters\\nanother year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting\\nthat another year would make the invitation needless,\\nby bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon\\'s wife,\\nand Marianne as THEIR visitor.\\n\\nFanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready\\nwit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,\\nto request her company and her sister\\'s, for some days,\\nin Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.\\nThis was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.\\nMrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;\\ncherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!\\nSuch an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,\\nabove all things, the most material to her interest,\\nand such an invitation the most gratifying to her\\nfeelings!  It was an advantage that could not be too\\ngratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;\\nand the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had\\nany precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been\\nalways meant to end in two days\\' time.\\n\\nWhen the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten\\nminutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,\\nsome share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark\\nof uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,\\nseemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose\\nfrom something more than merely malice against herself;\\nand might be brought, by time and address, to do\\nevery thing that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already\\nsubdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry\\ninto the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these\\nwere effects that laid open the probability of greater.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all\\nthat reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened\\nher expectation of the event.  Sir John, who called on\\nthem more than once, brought home such accounts of the\\nfavour they were in, as must be universally striking.\\nMrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any\\nyoung women in her life, as she was with them; had given\\neach of them a needle book made by some emigrant;\\ncalled Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know\\nwhether she should ever be able to part with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[At this point in the first and second edtions, Volume II ended.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 37\\n\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,\\nthat her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up\\nthe whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with\\nvisiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period\\nto her own home, and her own habits, in which she found\\nthe Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.\\n\\nAbout the third or fourth morning after their\\nbeing thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,\\non returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,\\nentered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting\\nby herself, with an air of such hurrying importance\\nas prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her\\ntime only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,\\nby saying,\\n\\n\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am.  What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.--\\nWhen I got to Mr. Palmer\\'s, I found Charlotte quite\\nin a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very\\nill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\\nSo I looked at it directly, and, \\'Lord! my dear,\\'\\nsays I, \\'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--\\'\\nand nurse said just the same.  But Charlotte, she would\\nnot be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily\\nhe happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\\nstepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,\\nbe said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world\\nbut the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.  And so,\\njust as he was going away again, it came into my head,\\nI am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,\\nbut it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.\\nSo upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,\\nand seemed to know something or other, and at last he\\nsaid in a whisper, \\'For fear any unpleasant report\\nshould reach the young ladies under your care as to their\\nsister\\'s indisposition, I think it advisable to say,\\nthat I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope\\nMrs. Dashwood will do very well.\\'\"\\n\\n\"What! is Fanny ill?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  \\'Lord!\\' says I,\\n\\'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?\\' So then it all came out; and the\\nlong and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,\\nseems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young\\nman I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\\nturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing\\nin it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged\\nabove this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There\\'s for you,\\nmy dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,\\nexcept Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--\\nThere is no great wonder in their liking one another;\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them,\\nand nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened\\nto see them together, or I am sure I should have found it\\nout directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,\\nfor fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--\\ntill this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a\\nwell-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.\\n\\'Lord!\\' thinks she to herself, \\'they are all so fond\\nof Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;\\'\\nand so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all\\nalone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to\\ncome--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five\\nminutes before, that she thought to make a match between\\nEdward and some Lord\\'s daughter or other, I forget who.\\nSo you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\\nand pride.  She fell into violent hysterics immediately,\\nwith such screams as reached your brother\\'s ears,\\nas he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,\\nthinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.\\nSo up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,\\nfor Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\\nwhat was going on.  Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,\\nI think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded\\nlike any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.\\nNancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;\\nand your brother, he walked about the room, and said\\nhe did not know what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared\\nthey should not stay a minute longer in the house,\\nand your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,\\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\\nup their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,\\nand he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\\nand Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.\\nThe carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\\ncousins away, and they were just stepping in as he\\ncame off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\\nshe could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.\\nI declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\\nwith all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.\\nLord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he\\nhears of it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for\\nthey say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.\\nI should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\\npassion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I\\nhad a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,\\nthat he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may\\nbe within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she\\nwas sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,\\nfor your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;\\nand so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for\\neither of them.  I have no notion of people\\'s making\\nsuch a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no\\nreason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;\\nfor I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well\\nby her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,\\nshe knows better than any body how to make the most\\nof every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\\nallow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good\\nan appearance with it as any body else would with eight.\\nLord! how snug they might live in such another cottage\\nas yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;\\nand I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my\\nBetty has a sister out of place, that would fit them\\nexactly.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had\\ntime enough to collect her thoughts, she was able\\nto give such an answer, and make such observations,\\nas the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\\nHappy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\ninterest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late\\noften hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her\\nat all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,\\nin the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able\\nto speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to\\ngive her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality\\non the conduct of every one concerned in it.\\n\\nShe could hardly determine what her own expectation\\nof its event really was; though she earnestly tried\\nto drive away the notion of its being possible to end\\notherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.\\nWhat Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could\\nnot be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;\\nand still more anxious to know how Edward would\\nconduct himself.  For HIM she felt much compassion;--\\nfor Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure\\nthat little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\\n\\nAs Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,\\nElinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for\\nits discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,\\nin making her acquainted with the real truth, and in\\nendeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,\\nor any resentment against Edward.\\n\\nElinor\\'s office was a painful one.--She was going\\nto remove what she really believed to be her sister\\'s\\nchief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she\\nfeared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and\\nto make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\\nwhich to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\\ndisappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such a task\\nmust be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore\\nhastened to perform it.\\n\\nShe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\\nfeelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,\\nany otherwise than as the self-command she had practised\\nsince her first knowledge of Edward\\'s engagement, might\\nsuggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\\nHer narration was clear and simple; and though it could\\nnot be given without emotion, it was not accompanied\\nby violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged\\nrather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,\\nand cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter\\nof others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;\\nand all the comfort that could be given by assurances\\nof her own composure of mind, and a very earnest\\nvindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,\\nwas readily offered.\\n\\nBut Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.\\nEdward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging\\nas Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,\\ncould she feel less than herself!  As for Lucy Steele,\\nshe considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could\\nnot be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards\\nto pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.\\nShe would not even admit it to have been natural;\\nand Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,\\nby that which only could convince her, a better knowledge\\nof mankind.\\n\\nHer first communication had reached no farther than\\nto state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time\\nit had existed.--Marianne\\'s feelings had then broken in,\\nand put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some\\ntime all that could be done was to soothe her distress,\\nlessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first\\nquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars,\\nwas,\\n\\n\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has\\nhe written to you?\"\\n\\n\"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy\\nfirst came to Barton Park last November, she told me\\nin confidence of her engagement.\"\\n\\nAt these words, Marianne\\'s eyes expressed the astonishment\\nwhich her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,\\nshe exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\\n\\nElinor confirmed it.\\n\\n\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this\\nbeen on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being\\nhappy!\"--\\n\\n\"It was not fit that you should then know how much\\nI was the reverse!\"\\n\\n\"Four months!\"--cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!--\\nso cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--\\n\\n\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to\\nLucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,\\nto avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my\\nfamily and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,\\nwhich it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"\\n\\nMarianne seemed much struck.\\n\\n\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\\nmother,\" added Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it;--\\nbut without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--\\n\\n\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort\\nof others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing\\nhow much I felt.  Now, I can think and speak of it with\\nlittle emotion.  I would not have you suffer on my account;\\nfor I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.\\nI have many things to support me.  I am not conscious of having\\nprovoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,\\nI have borne it as much as possible without spreading\\nit farther.  I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.\\nI wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always\\ndoing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,\\nin the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,\\nand that is the foundation on which every thing good may\\nbe built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is\\nbewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,\\nand all that can be said of one\\'s happiness depending\\nentirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it\\nis not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--\\nEdward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior\\nin person and understanding to half her sex; and time\\nand habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\\nanother superior to HER.\"--\\n\\n\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne,\\n\"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily\\nto be made up by something else, your resolution,\\nyour self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\\nwondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever\\nfelt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this\\nhanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak\\nof it to a single creature; knowing that it would make\\nyou and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\nto you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--\\nIt was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the\\nvery person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all\\nmy prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--\\nThis person\\'s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,\\nby endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\\ndeeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have\\nhad her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--\\nI have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,\\nwithout hearing one circumstance that could make me less\\ndesire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;\\nnor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--\\nI have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,\\nand the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the\\npunishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--\\nAnd all this has been going on at a time, when, as you\\nknow too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--\\nIf you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you\\nmay suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure\\nof mind with which I have brought myself at present\\nto consider the matter, the consolation that I have been\\nwilling to admit, have been the effect of constant and\\npainful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--\\nthey did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--\\nNo, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,\\nperhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I\\nowed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was\\nVERY unhappy.\"--\\n\\nMarianne was quite subdued.--\\n\\n\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate\\nmyself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--\\nyou, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me\\nin all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering\\nfor me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I\\ncan make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself,\\nI have been trying to do it away.\"\\n\\nThe tenderest caresses followed this confession.\\nIn such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had\\nno difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\\nshe required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least\\nappearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying\\nthe smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see\\nEdward himself, if chance should bring them together,\\nwithout any diminution of her usual cordiality.--\\nThese were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt\\nthat she had injured, no reparation could be too much\\nfor her to make.\\n\\nShe performed her promise of being discreet,\\nto admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings\\nhad to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,\\ndissented from her in nothing, and was heard three\\ntimes to say, \"Yes, ma\\'am.\"--She listened to her praise\\nof Lucy with only moving from one chair to another,\\nand when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward\\'s affection,\\nit cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances\\ntowards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal\\nto any thing herself.\\n\\nThe next morning brought a farther trial of it,\\nin a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious\\naspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them\\nnews of his wife.\\n\\n\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity,\\nas soon as he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery\\nthat took place under our roof yesterday.\"\\n\\nThey all looked their assent; it seemed too awful\\na moment for speech.\\n\\n\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully.\\nMrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such\\ncomplicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may\\nbe weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.\\nPoor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.\\nBut I would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there\\nis nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution\\nis a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.\\nShe has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!\\nShe says she never shall think well of anybody again;\\nand one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--\\nmeeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness\\nhad been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!  It\\nwas quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she\\nhad asked these young women to her house; merely because\\nshe thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\\nwell-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;\\nfor otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\\nand Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,\\nwas attending her daughter.  And now to be so rewarded!\\n\\'I wish, with all my heart,\\' says poor Fanny in her\\naffectionate way, \\'that we had asked your sisters instead\\nof them.\\'\"\\n\\nHere he stopped to be thanked; which being done,\\nhe went on.\\n\\n\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny\\nbroke it to her, is not to be described.  While she with\\nthe truest affection had been planning a most eligible\\nconnection for him, was it to be supposed that he could\\nbe all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such\\na suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she\\nsuspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be\\nin THAT quarter.  \\'THERE, to be sure,\\' said she, \\'I might\\nhave thought myself safe.\\' She was quite in an agony.\\nWe consulted together, however, as to what should be done,\\nand at last she determined to send for Edward.\\nHe came.  But I am sorry to relate what ensued.\\nAll that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end\\nto the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\\nby my arguments, and Fanny\\'s entreaties, was of\\nno avail.  Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.\\nI never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.\\nHis mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case\\nof his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on\\nhim the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings\\nin a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\\ngrew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition\\nto this, if he still persisted in this low connection,\\nrepresented to him the certain penury that must attend\\nthe match.  His own two thousand pounds she protested\\nshould be his all; she would never see him again; and so far\\nwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance,\\nthat if he were to enter into any profession with a view\\nof better support, she would do all in her power to prevent\\nhim advancing in it.\"\\n\\nHere Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,\\nclapped her hands together, and cried, \"Gracious God!\\ncan this be possible!\"\\n\\n\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother,\\n\"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.\\nYour exclamation is very natural.\"\\n\\nMarianne was going to retort, but she remembered\\nher promises, and forbore.\\n\\n\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.\\nEdward said very little; but what he did say, was in\\nthe most determined manner.  Nothing should prevail on\\nhim to give up his engagement.  He would stand to it,\\ncost him what it might.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,\\nno longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest\\nman! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had\\ndone otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.\\nI have some little concern in the business, as well\\nas yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe\\nthere is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one\\nwho more deserves a good husband.\"\\n\\nJohn Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature\\nwas calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished\\nto offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.\\nHe therefore replied, without any resentment,\\n\\n\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\\nrelation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,\\na very deserving young woman, but in the present case\\nyou know, the connection must be impossible.\\nAnd to have entered into a secret engagement with a\\nyoung man under her uncle\\'s care, the son of a woman\\nespecially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,\\nis perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,\\nI do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\\nwhom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish\\nher extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct throughout\\nthe whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,\\nin like circumstances, would adopt.  It has been dignified\\nand liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear\\nit will be a bad one.\"\\n\\nMarianne sighed out her similar apprehension;\\nand Elinor\\'s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,\\nwhile braving his mother\\'s threats, for a woman who could\\nnot reward him.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--\\nEdward is dismissed for ever from his mother\\'s notice.\\nHe left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether\\nhe is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can\\nmake no inquiry.\"\\n\\n\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\\n\\n\"What, indeed, ma\\'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.\\nBorn to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive\\na situation more deplorable.  The interest of two thousand\\npounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added\\nthe recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,\\nwithin three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has\\nthirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself\\na more wretched condition.  We must all feel for him;\\nand the more so, because it is totally out of our power\\nto assist him.\"\\n\\n\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure\\nhe should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;\\nand so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit\\nthat he should be living about at his own charge now,\\nat lodgings and taverns.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward,\\nthough she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\\n\\n\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\"\\nsaid John Dashwood, \"as all his friends were disposed to do\\nby him, he might now have been in his proper situation,\\nand would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must\\nbe out of anybody\\'s power to assist him.  And there is one\\nthing more preparing against him, which must be worse than\\nall--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind\\nof spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,\\nwhich might have been Edward\\'s, on proper conditions.\\nI left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over\\nthe business.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is HER revenge.\\nEverybody has a way of their own.  But I don\\'t think mine\\nwould be, to make one son independent, because another had\\nplagued me.\"\\n\\nMarianne got up and walked about the room.\\n\\n\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\"\\ncontinued John, \"than to see his younger brother in\\npossession of an estate which might have been his own?\\nPoor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.\"\\n\\nA few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,\\nconcluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his\\nsisters that he really believed there was no material\\ndanger in Fanny\\'s indisposition, and that they need\\nnot therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\\non the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded\\nMrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct, the Dashwoods\\', and Edward\\'s.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s indignation burst forth as soon as he\\nquitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve\\nimpossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings,\\nthey all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 38\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward\\'s\\nconduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its\\ntrue merit.  THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt\\nhim to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,\\nbeyond the consciousness of doing right, that could\\nremain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.\\nElinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all\\nhis offences in compassion for his punishment.  But though\\nconfidence between them was, by this public discovery,\\nrestored to its proper state, it was not a subject on\\nwhich either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.\\nElinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still\\nmore upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive\\nassurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward\\'s continued\\naffection for herself which she rather wished to do away;\\nand Marianne\\'s courage soon failed her, in trying\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more\\ndissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison\\nit necessarily produced between Elinor\\'s conduct and her own.\\n\\nShe felt all the force of that comparison; but not\\nas her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;\\nshe felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,\\nregretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\\nherself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\\nwithout the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened\\nthat she still fancied present exertion impossible,\\nand therefore it only dispirited her more.\\n\\nNothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,\\nof affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett\\'s Buildings.\\nBut though so much of the matter was known to them already,\\nthat Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\\nthat knowledge farther, without seeking after more,\\nshe had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;\\nand nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,\\nhad prevented her going to them within that time.\\n\\nThe third day succeeding their knowledge of the\\nparticulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw\\nmany to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second\\nweek in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;\\nbut Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again\\nin town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,\\nchose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public\\na place.\\n\\nAn intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined\\nthem soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was\\nnot sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging\\nall Mrs. Jennings\\'s conversation, she was herself left\\nto quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\\nnothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody\\nwho could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting\\nto her.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,\\naccosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,\\nexpressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving\\nencouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\\nleft her own party for a short time, to join their\\'s.\\nMrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,\\n\\n\"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you\\nany thing if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\\n\\nIt was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings\\'s curiosity\\nand Elinor\\'s too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT\\nbeing asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.\\n\\n\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele,\\ntaking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you\\nof all things in the world.\"  And then lowering her voice,\\n\"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.\\nIs she angry?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\\n\\n\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\\n\\n\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have\\nhad such a time of it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage\\nin my life.  She vowed at first she would never trim me\\nup a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,\\nso long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,\\nand we are as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me\\nthis bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.\\nThere now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.  But why\\nshould not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS\\nthe Doctor\\'s favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,\\nI should never have known he DID like it better than\\nany other colour, if he had not happened to say so.\\nMy cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare sometimes\\nI do not know which way to look before them.\"\\n\\nShe had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor\\nhad nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient\\nto find her way back again to the first.\\n\\n\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly,\\n\"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars\\'s\\ndeclaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing\\nI can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured\\nreports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think\\nabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other\\npeople to set it down for certain.\"\\n\\n\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,\\nI assure you,\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well,\\nand by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,\\nthat nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars\\nto give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand\\npounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\\nnothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.\\nAnd besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,\\nthat when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars\\nwould be off; and when Edward did not come near us\\nfor three days, I could not tell what to think myself;\\nand I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;\\nfor we came away from your brother\\'s Wednesday,\\nand we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,\\nand Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.\\nOnce Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits\\nrose against that.  However this morning he came just\\nas we came home from church; and then it all came out,\\nhow he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them,\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved\\nnobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.\\nAnd how he had been so worried by what passed,\\nthat as soon as he had went away from his mother\\'s house,\\nhe had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,\\nsome where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn\\nall Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better\\nof it.  And after thinking it all over and over again,\\nhe said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\\nand no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep\\nher on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,\\nfor he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope\\nof any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,\\nas he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,\\nand how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear\\nto think of her doing no better, and so he begged,\\nif she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the\\nmatter directly, and leave him shift for himself.\\nI heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\\nAnd it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,\\nthat he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.\\nI will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\\ntired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any\\nthing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give\\near to such kind of talking; so she told him directly\\n(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,\\nand all that--Oh, la! one can\\'t repeat such kind of things\\nyou know)--she told him directly, she had not the least\\nmind in the world to be off, for she could live with him\\nupon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,\\nshe should be very glad to have it all, you know,\\nor something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,\\nand talked on some time about what they should do,\\nand they agreed he should take orders directly,\\nand they must wait to be married till he got a living.\\nAnd just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\\ncalled from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in\\nher coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;\\nso I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,\\nto ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not\\ncare to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put\\non a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"\\nsaid Elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,\\nwere not you?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you\\nthink people make love when any body else is by?  Oh,\\nfor shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.\\n(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the\\ndrawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening\\nat the door.\"\\n\\n\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me\\nwhat you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?\\nI am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly\\nwould not have suffered you to give me particulars of a\\nconversation which you ought not to have known yourself.\\nHow could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at\\nthe door, and heard what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would\\nhave done just the same by me; for a year or two back,\\nwhen Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,\\nshe never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind\\na chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\\n\\nElinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss\\nSteele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,\\nfrom what was uppermost in her mind.\\n\\n\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she;\\n\"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an\\nill-natured woman his mother is, an\\'t she? And your\\nbrother and sister were not very kind! However,\\nI shan\\'t say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure\\nthey did send us home in their own chariot, which\\nwas more than I looked for.  And for my part, I was all\\nin a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the\\nhuswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\\nnothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine\\nout of sight.  Edward have got some business at Oxford,\\nhe says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,\\nas soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.\\nI wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!\\n(giggling as she spoke) I\\'d lay my life I know what\\nmy cousins will say, when they hear of it.  They will\\ntell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward\\nthe curacy of his new living.  I know they will; but I am\\nsure I would not do such a thing for all the world.--\\n\\'La!\\' I shall say directly, \\'I wonder how you could think\\nof such a thing?  I write to the Doctor, indeed!\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared\\nagainst the worst.  You have got your answer ready.\"\\n\\nMiss Steele was going to reply on the same subject,\\nbut the approach of her own party made another more necessary.\\n\\n\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal\\nmore to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not\\nany longer.  I assure you they are very genteel people.\\nHe makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their\\nown coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about\\nit myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she\\nis not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same;\\nand if anything should happen to take you and your\\nsister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company,\\nI am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her\\nfor as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton\\nwon\\'t ask us any more this bout.  Good-by; I am sorry\\nMiss Marianne was not here.  Remember me kindly to her.\\nLa! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder\\nyou was not afraid of its being torn.\"\\n\\nSuch was her parting concern; for after this, she had\\ntime only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,\\nbefore her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson;\\nand Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which\\nmight feed her powers of reflection some time, though she\\nhad learnt very little more than what had been already\\nforeseen and foreplanned in her own mind.  Edward\\'s marriage\\nwith Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time\\nof its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,\\nas she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,\\nexactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,\\nof which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.\\n\\nAs soon as they returned to the carriage,\\nMrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor\\nwished to spread as little as possible intelligence\\nthat had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such\\nsimple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy,\\nfor the sake of her own consequence, would choose\\nto have known.  The continuance of their engagement,\\nand the means that were able to be taken for promoting\\nits end, was all her communication; and this produced\\nfrom Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.\\n\\n\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how\\nTHAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding\\nno good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty\\npounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,\\nand what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can\\ngive her.--Then they will have a child every year! and\\nLord help \\'em! how poor they will be!--I must see\\nwhat I can give them towards furnishing their house.\\nTwo maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t\\'other\\nday.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.--\\nBetty\\'s sister would never do for them NOW.\"\\n\\nThe next morning brought Elinor a letter by the\\ntwo-penny post from Lucy herself.  It was as follows:\\n\\n                    \"Bartlett\\'s Building, March.\\n\\n     \"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the\\n     liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your\\n     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such\\n     a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after\\n     all the troubles we have went through lately,\\n     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed\\n     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered\\n     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy\\n     as we must always be in one another\\'s love.  We have\\n     had great trials, and great persecutions, but\\n     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge\\n     many friends, yourself not the least among them,\\n     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully\\n     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of\\n     it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise\\n     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with\\n     him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our\\n     parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my\\n     duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,\\n     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would\\n     he consent to it; but he said it should never be,\\n     he did not regard his mother\\'s anger, while he could\\n     have my affections; our prospects are not very\\n     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for\\n     the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should\\n     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any\\n     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you\\n     will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,\\n     trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John,\\n     or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to\\n     assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what\\n     she did, but she did it for the best, so I say\\n     nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won\\'t think it too much\\n     trouble to give us a call, should she come this way\\n     any morning, \\'twould be a great kindness, and my\\n     cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds\\n     me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully\\n     and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John,\\n     and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you\\n     chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,\\n\\n                                      \"I am, &c.\"\\n\\nAs soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed\\nwhat she concluded to be its writer\\'s real design,\\nby placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it\\naloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.\\n\\n\"Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye,\\nthat was quite proper to let him be off if he would.\\nThat was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get\\nhim a living, with all my heart.--She calls me dear\\nMrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a good-hearted girl\\nas ever lived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence\\nis very prettily turned.  Yes, yes, I will go and see her,\\nsure enough.  How attentive she is, to think of every\\nbody!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is\\nas pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy\\'s head\\nand heart great credit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 39\\n\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than\\ntwo months in town, and Marianne\\'s impatience to be gone\\nincreased every day.  She sighed for the air, the liberty,\\nthe quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place\\ncould give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much\\nless bent on its being effected immediately, as that she\\nwas conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,\\nwhich Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.\\nShe began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards\\nits accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes\\nto their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the\\neloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,\\nwhich, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\\nlonger, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible\\nthan any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland\\nabout the end of March, for the Easter holidays;\\nand Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very\\nwarm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.  This would\\nnot, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of\\nMiss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real\\npoliteness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very\\ngreat amendment of his manners towards them since her\\nsister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept\\nit with pleasure.\\n\\nWhen she told Marianne what she had done, however,\\nher first reply was not very auspicious.\\n\\n\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation.\\n\"No, I cannot go to Cleveland.\"--\\n\\n\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation\\nis not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of...\"\\n\\n\"But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go\\ninto Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward\\nto going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.\"\\n\\nElinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\\nsuch feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by\\nworking on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure\\nwhich would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,\\nwhom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,\\nmore comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,\\nand perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,\\nwhich was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to\\nBarton was not beyond one day, though a long day\\'s journey;\\nand their mother\\'s servant might easily come there to attend\\nthem down; and as there could be no occasion of their\\nstaying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at\\nhome in little more than three weeks\\' time.  As Marianne\\'s\\naffection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph\\nwith little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,\\nthat she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again\\nfrom Cleveland.  Elinor was grateful for the attention,\\nbut it could not alter her design; and their mother\\'s\\nconcurrence being readily gained, every thing relative\\nto their return was arranged as far as it could be;--\\nand Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement\\nof the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.\\n\\n\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall\\ndo without the Miss Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\naddress to him when he first called on her, after their\\nleaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved\\nupon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we\\nshall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape\\nat one another as dull as two cats.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous\\nsketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make\\nthat offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--\\nand if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think\\nher object gained; for, on Elinor\\'s moving to the window\\nto take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,\\nwhich she was going to copy for her friend, he followed\\nher to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed\\nwith her there for several minutes.  The effect of his\\ndiscourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,\\nfor though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\\nchanged her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,\\nto one close by the piano forte on which Marianne\\nwas playing, she could not keep herself from seeing\\nthat Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,\\nand was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--\\nStill farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval\\nof Marianne\\'s turning from one lesson to another,\\nsome words of the Colonel\\'s inevitably reached her ear,\\nin which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\\nof his house.  This set the matter beyond a doubt.\\nShe wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary\\nto do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.\\nWhat Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,\\nbut judged from the motion of her lips, that she did\\nnot think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings\\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest.\\nThey then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\\ncatching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne\\'s\\nperformance brought her these words in the Colonel\\'s calm voice,--\\n\\n\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\\n\\nAstonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech,\\nshe was almost ready to cry out, \"Lord! what should\\nhinder it?\"--but checking her desire, confined herself\\nto this silent ejaculation.\\n\\n\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\\n\\nThis delay on the Colonel\\'s side, however, did not\\nseem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,\\nfor on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,\\nand moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard\\nElinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,\\n\\n\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,\\nand only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,\\nthe Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he\\nimmediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away\\nwithout making her any reply!--She had not thought her old\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\\n\\nWhat had really passed between them was to this effect.\\n\\n\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion,\\n\"of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered\\nfrom his family; for if I understand the matter right,\\nhe has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\\nin his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--\\nHave I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"\\n\\nElinor told him that it was.\\n\\n\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied,\\nwith great feeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide,\\ntwo young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--\\nMrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what\\nshe may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr. Ferrars two\\nor three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased\\nwith him.  He is not a young man with whom one can\\nbe intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have\\nseen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,\\nand as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.\\nI understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you\\nbe so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,\\nnow just vacant, as I am informed by this day\\'s post,\\nis his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,\\nperhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,\\nit may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it\\nwere more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;\\nthe late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than\\n200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable\\nof improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as\\nto afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,\\nhowever, my pleasure in presenting him to it,\\nwill be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s astonishment at this commission could\\nhardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really\\nmaking her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,\\nwhich only two days before she had considered as hopeless\\nfor Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--\\nand SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to\\nbestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had\\nattributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor\\nfeelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share\\nin that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship,\\nwhich together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,\\nwere strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him\\nfor it with all her heart, spoke of Edward\\'s principles and\\ndisposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;\\nand promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,\\nif it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\nto another.  But at the same time, she could not help\\nthinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.\\nIt was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\\nEdward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,\\nshe would have been very glad to be spared herself;--\\nbut Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,\\ndeclining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being\\ngiven through her means, that she would not on any account\\nmake farther opposition.  Edward, she believed, was still in\\ntown,\\nand fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.\\nShe could undertake therefore to inform him of it,\\nin the course of the day.  After this had been settled,\\nColonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage\\nin securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,\\nand THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the\\nhouse was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,\\nas Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,\\nat least as far as regarded its size.\\n\\n\"The smallness of the house,\" said she,\\n\"I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,\\nfor it will be in proportion to their family and income.\"\\n\\nBy which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE\\nwas considering Mr. Ferrars\\'s marriage as the certain\\nconsequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it\\npossible that Delaford living could supply such an income,\\nas anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--\\nand he said so.\\n\\n\"This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars\\ncomfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.\\nI am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;\\nand my interest is hardly more extensive.  If, however,\\nby an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve\\nhim farther, I must think very differently of him\\nfrom what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful\\nto him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.\\nWhat I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,\\nsince it can advance him so little towards what must\\nbe his principal, his only object of happiness.\\nHis marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,\\nI am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--\"\\n\\nSuch was the sentence which, when misunderstood,\\nso justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;\\nbut after this narration of what really passed between\\nColonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window,\\nthe gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may\\nperhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from\\nan offer of marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 40\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nsagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,\\n\"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;\\nfor though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,\\nI could not help catching enough to understand his business.\\nAnd I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,\\nand I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor.  \"It is a matter\\nof great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel\\nBrandon most sensibly.  There are not many men who would\\nact as he has done.  Few people who have so compassionate\\na heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an\\'t the least\\nastonished at it in the world, for I have often thought\\nof late, there was nothing more likely to happen.\"\\n\\n\"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel\\'s\\ngeneral benevolence; but at least you could not foresee\\nthat the opportunity would so very soon occur.\"\\n\\n\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that,\\nwhen a man has once made up his mind to such a thing,\\nsomehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.\\nWell, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again;\\nand if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think\\nI shall soon know where to look for them.\"\\n\\n\"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\"\\nsaid Elinor, with a faint smile.\\n\\n\"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house\\nbeing a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at,\\nfor it is as good a one as ever I saw.\"\\n\\n\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it?--\\nwho should do it but himself?\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the servant\\'s coming in to\\nannounce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings\\nimmediately preparing to go, said,--\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half\\nmy talk out.  But, however, we may have it all over in\\nthe evening; for we shall be quite alone.  I do not ask\\nyou to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full\\nof the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\\nlong to tell your sister all about it.\"\\n\\nMarianne had left the room before the conversation began.\\n\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am, I shall tell Marianne of it;\\nbut I shall not mention it at present to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very well,\" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.\\n\"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think\\nof going as far as Holborn to-day.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, not even Lucy if you please.\\nOne day\\'s delay will not be very material; and till I\\nhave written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be\\nmentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.\\nIt is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to\\nhis ordination.\"\\n\\nThis speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.\\nWhy Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it\\nin such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.\\nA few moments\\' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,\\nand she exclaimed;--\\n\\n\"Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be\\nthe man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure,\\nhe must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad\\nto find things are so forward between you.  But, my dear,\\nis not this rather out of character?  Should not the Colonel\\nwrite himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\"\\n\\nElinor did not quite understand the beginning of\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s speech, neither did she think it worth\\ninquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather\\nwished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars\\nthan himself.\"\\n\\n\"And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd\\nkind of delicacy!  However, I will not disturb you (seeing\\nher preparing to write.)  You know your own concerns best.\\nSo goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of any thing to\\nplease me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.\"\\n\\nAnd away she went; but returning again in a moment,\\n\\n\"I have just been thinking of Betty\\'s sister, my dear.\\nI should be very glad to get her so good a mistress.\\nBut whether she would do for a lady\\'s maid, I am sure I\\ncan\\'t tell.  She is an excellent housemaid, and works\\nvery well at her needle.  However, you will think of all\\nthat at your leisure.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing\\nmuch of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,\\nthan to be mistress of the subject.\\n\\nHow she should begin--how she should express\\nherself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern.\\nThe particular circumstances between them made\\na difficulty of that which to any other person would\\nhave been the easiest thing in the world; but she\\nequally feared to say too much or too little, and sat\\ndeliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,\\ntill broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\\n\\nHe had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to\\nthe carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she,\\nafter apologising for not returning herself, had obliged\\nhim to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,\\nand wanted to speak with him on very particular business.\\n\\nElinor had just been congratulating herself,\\nin the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it\\nmight be to express herself properly by letter, it was\\nat least preferable to giving the information by word\\nof mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this\\ngreatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had\\nnot seen him before since his engagement became public,\\nand therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\\nwith it; which, with the consciousness of what she\\nhad been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,\\nmade her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.\\nHe too was much distressed; and they sat down together\\nin a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he\\nhad asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\\ninto the room, he could not recollect; but determining\\nto be on the safe side, he made his apology in form\\nas soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished\\nto speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I\\ncertainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;\\nthough at the same time, I should have been extremely\\nsorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\\nespecially as it will most likely be some time--it\\nis not probable that I should soon have the pleasure\\nof meeting you again.  I go to Oxford tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor,\\nrecovering herself, and determined to get over what she\\nso much dreaded as soon as possible, \"without receiving\\nour good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them\\nin person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.\\nI have something of consequence to inform you of,\\nwhich I was on the point of communicating by paper.\\nI am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing\\nrather faster than usual as she spoke.)  Colonel Brandon,\\nwho was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,\\nthat understanding you mean to take orders, he has\\ngreat pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford\\nnow just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.\\nAllow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\\nand well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\\nthe living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much\\nmore considerable, and such as might better enable you\\nto--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to\\nyourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views\\nof happiness.\"\\n\\nWhat Edward felt, as he could not say it himself,\\nit cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.\\nHe LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,\\nsuch unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;\\nbut he said only these two words,\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,\\nas some of the worst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means\\nit as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\\npassed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\\nconduct of your family has placed you--a concern\\nwhich I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,\\nmust share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\\nfor your general character, and his particular approbation\\nof your behaviour on the present occasion.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"The unkindness of your own relations has made you\\nastonished to find friendship any where.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to\\nfind it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you,\\nto your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express\\nit if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator.\"\\n\\n\"You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you\\nthat you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,\\nto your own merit, and Colonel Brandon\\'s discernment\\nof it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,\\ntill I understood his design, that the living was vacant;\\nnor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\\nhad such a living in his gift.  As a friend of mine,\\nof my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,\\nyou owe nothing to my solicitation.\"\\n\\nTruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\\nin the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling\\nto appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged\\nit with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix\\nthat suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.\\nFor a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased\\nto speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.\\nI have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother\\nI know esteems him highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man,\\nand in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him,\\non farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,\\nand as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand\\nthe parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)\\nit is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this.\"\\n\\nEdward made no answer; but when she had turned\\naway her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,\\nso uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish\\nthe distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house\\nmuch greater.\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\"\\nsaid he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.\\n\\nElinor told him the number of the house.\\n\\n\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks\\nwhich you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him\\nthat he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man.\"\\n\\nElinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted,\\nwith a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing\\ngood wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\\nthat might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to\\nreturn the same good will, than the power of expressing it.\\n\\n\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself,\\nas the door shut him out, \"I shall see him the husband\\nof Lucy.\"\\n\\nAnd with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down\\nto reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour\\nto comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,\\nto reflect on her own with discontent.\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned\\nfrom seeing people whom she had never seen before,\\nand of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,\\nher mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\\nin her possession, than by anything else, that she\\nreverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up to the\\nyoung man.  Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had\\nno great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling\\nto accept your proposal?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am; THAT was not very likely.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems\\nall to depend upon that.\"\\n\\n\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind\\nof forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time,\\nor the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three\\nmonths will complete his ordination.\"\\n\\n\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear,\\nhow calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two\\nor three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME\\nquite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad\\nto do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is\\nnot worth while to wait two or three months for him.\\nSure somebody else might be found that would do as well;\\nsomebody that is in orders already.\"\\n\\n\"My dear ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--\\nWhy, Colonel Brandon\\'s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade\\nme that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\\nten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!\"\\n\\nThe deception could not continue after this;\\nand an explanation immediately took place, by which both\\ngained considerable amusement for the moment, without any\\nmaterial loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings\\nonly exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\\nwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she,\\nafter the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\\nwas over, \"and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear\\na man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my\\nknowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I\\nthink the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--\\nand to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!--\\nIt seems quite ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must\\ntouch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,\\nand make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it.\"\\n\\n\"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea\\nof the living\\'s being enough to allow them to marry.\"\\n\\n\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two\\nthousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry\\non less.  Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall\\nbe paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas;\\nand I am sure I sha\\'nt go if Lucy an\\'t there.\"\\n\\nElinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability\\nof their not waiting for any thing more.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 41\\n\\n\\nEdward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon,\\nproceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the\\nexcess of it by the time he reached Bartlett\\'s Buildings,\\nthat she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called\\non her again the next day with her congratulations,\\nthat she had never seen him in such spirits before\\nin her life.\\n\\nHer own happiness, and her own spirits, were at\\nleast very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most\\nheartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably\\ntogether in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.\\nSo far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness\\nto give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her,\\nthat she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most\\ngrateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation\\nto her, and openly declared that no exertion for their\\ngood on Miss Dashwood\\'s part, either present or future,\\nwould ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of\\ndoing any thing in the world for those she really valued.\\nAs for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship\\nhim as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that\\nhe should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;\\nanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost;\\nand scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford,\\nas far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage,\\nhis cows, and his poultry.\\n\\nIt was now above a week since John Dashwood had\\ncalled in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no notice\\nhad been taken by them of his wife\\'s indisposition,\\nbeyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it\\nnecessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation,\\nhowever, which not only opposed her own inclination,\\nbut which had not the assistance of any encouragement\\nfrom her companions.  Marianne, not contented with\\nabsolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent\\nto prevent her sister\\'s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,\\nthough her carriage was always at Elinor\\'s service,\\nso very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her\\ncuriosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,\\nnor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward\\'s part,\\ncould overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.\\nThe consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself\\nto pay a visit, for which no one could really have\\nless inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete\\nwith a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\\nreason to dislike.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could\\nturn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.\\nHe expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her\\nthat he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street,\\nand, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,\\ninvited her to come in.\\n\\nThey walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.\\n\\n\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I\\nwill go to her presently, for I am sure she will not\\nhave the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.--\\nVery far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there\\ncannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always\\ngreat favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\"--\\n\\nElinor made what excuse she could for her.\\n\\n\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied,\\n\"for I have a good deal to say to you.  This living\\nof Colonel Brandon\\'s--can it be true?--has he really given\\nit to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\\n\\n\"It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given\\nthe living of Delaford to Edward.\"\\n\\n\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no\\nrelationship!--no connection between them!--and now\\nthat livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?\"\\n\\n\"About two hundred a year.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living\\nof that value--supposing the late incumbent to have\\nbeen old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he\\nmight have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.\\nAnd how came he not to have settled that matter before this\\nperson\\'s death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it,\\nbut a man of Colonel Brandon\\'s sense!--I wonder he should\\nbe so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,\\nconcern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal\\nof inconsistency in almost every human character.  I suppose,\\nhowever--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS.\\nEdward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\\nthe Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough\\nto take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\\n\\nElinor contradicted it, however, very positively;\\nand by relating that she had herself been employed\\nin conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward,\\nand, therefore, must understand the terms on which it\\nwas given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\\n\\n\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing\\nwhat she said--\"what could be the Colonel\\'s motive?\"\\n\\n\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,\\nEdward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter\\nto Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her,\\nand she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear\\nit much talked of.\"\\n\\nElinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing,\\nthat she thought Fanny might have borne with composure,\\nan acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither\\nshe nor her child could be possibly impoverished.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the\\ntone becoming so important a subject, \"knows nothing\\nabout it at present, and I believe it will be best to\\nkeep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--\\nWhen the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear\\nof it all.\"\\n\\n\"But why should such precaution be used?--Though\\nit is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have\\nthe smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\\nmoney enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite\\nout of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,\\nis she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her\\nson, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those\\nover whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.\\nSurely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\\nto any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--\\nshe cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--\\nShe would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\\nof a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good,\\nbut it is founded on ignorance of human nature.\\nWhen Edward\\'s unhappy match takes place, depend upon it\\nhis mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;\\nand, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\\ndreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\\nMrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly\\nhave escaped her memory by THIS time.\"\\n\\n\"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one\\nof the most affectionate mothers in the world.\"\\n\\nElinor was silent.\\n\\n\"We think NOW,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause,\\n\"of ROBERT\\'S marrying Miss Morton.\"\\n\\nElinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance\\nof her brother\\'s tone, calmly replied,\\n\\n\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner\\nof speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether\\nshe marry Edward or Robert.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert\\nwill now to all intents and purposes be considered\\nas the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are\\nboth very agreeable young men: I do not know that one\\nis superior to the other.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more, and John was also for a short\\ntime silent.--His reflections ended thus.\\n\\n\"Of ONE thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand,\\nand speaking in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you;--\\nand I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you.\\nI have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the\\nbest authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but\\nI have it from the very best authority--not that I ever\\nprecisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her\\ndaughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short,\\nwhatever objections there might be against a certain--a\\ncertain connection--you understand me--it would have been\\nfar preferable to her, it would not have given her half\\nthe vexation that THIS does.  I was exceedingly pleased\\nto hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--\\na very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.\\n\\'It would have been beyond comparison,\\' she said, \\'the least\\nevil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW\\nfor nothing worse.\\' But however, all that is quite out\\nof the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--\\nas to any attachment you know--it never could be--all\\nthat is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you\\nof this, because I knew how much it must please you.\\nNot that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor.  There\\nis no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well,\\nor better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has Colonel\\nBrandon been with you lately?\"\\n\\nElinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity,\\nand raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves\\nand fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be\\nspared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,\\nand from the danger of hearing any thing more from\\nher brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.\\nAfter a few moments\\' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that\\nFanny was yet uninformed of her sister\\'s being there,\\nquitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left\\nto improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the\\ngay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner\\nwhile enjoying so unfair a division of his mother\\'s love\\nand liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,\\nearned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that\\nbrother\\'s integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable\\nopinion of his head and heart.\\n\\nThey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,\\nbefore he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard\\nof the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject.\\nElinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them\\nto John; and their effect on Robert, though very different,\\nwas not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed\\nmost immoderately.  The idea of Edward\\'s being a clergyman,\\nand living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him\\nbeyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful\\nimagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice,\\nand publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and\\nMary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\\n\\nElinor, while she waited in silence and immovable\\ngravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain\\nher eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke\\nall the contempt it excited.  It was a look, however,\\nvery well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave\\nno intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\\nnot by any reproof of her\\'s, but by his own sensibility.\\n\\n\"We may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last,\\nrecovering from the affected laugh which had considerably\\nlengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--\"but, upon\\nmy soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor Edward!\\nhe is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--\\nfor I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as\\nwell-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.\\nYou must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR\\nslight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly\\nnot the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born,\\nyou know, with the same powers,--the same address.--\\nPoor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--\\nto be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,\\nI believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;\\nand I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my\\nlife, as when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.--\\nMy mother was the first person who told me of it;\\nand I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\\nimmediately said to her, \\'My dear madam, I do not know\\nwhat you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself,\\nI must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman,\\nI never will see him again.\\' That was what I said immediately.--\\nI was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has\\ndone for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from\\nall decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother,\\nI am not in the least surprised at it; from his style\\nof education, it was always to be expected.  My poor mother\\nwas half frantic.\"\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen the lady?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house,\\nI happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw\\nquite enough of her.  The merest awkward country girl,\\nwithout style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--\\nI remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I\\nshould suppose likely to captivate poor Edward.\\nI offered immediately, as soon as my mother related\\nthe affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade\\nhim from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found,\\nto do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way\\nat first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach\\nhad taken place, when it was not for me, you know,\\nto interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few\\nhours earlier--I think it is most probable--that something\\nmight have been hit on.  I certainly should have represented\\nit to Edward in a very strong light.  \\'My dear fellow,\\'\\nI should have said, \\'consider what you are doing.\\nYou are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one\\nas your family are unanimous in disapproving.\\' I cannot\\nhelp thinking, in short, that means might have been found.\\nBut now it is all too late.  He must be starved, you know;--\\nthat is certain; absolutely starved.\"\\n\\nHe had just settled this point with great composure,\\nwhen the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the\\nsubject.\\nBut though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family,\\nElinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something\\nlike confusion of countenance with which she entered,\\nand an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.\\nShe even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find\\nthat Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town,\\nas she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion\\nin which her husband, who attended her into the room,\\nand hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish\\nevery thing that was most affectionate and graceful.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 42\\n\\n\\nOne other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor\\nreceived her brother\\'s congratulations on their travelling\\nso far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two,\\ncompleted the intercourse of the brother and sisters\\nin town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come\\nto Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way,\\nwhich of all things was the most unlikely to occur,\\nwith a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John\\nto Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come\\nto see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting\\nin the country.\\n\\nIt amused her to observe that all her friends seemed\\ndetermined to send her to Delaford;--a place, in which,\\nof all others, she would now least chuse to visit,\\nor wish to reside; for not only was it considered as\\nher future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy,\\nwhen they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.\\n\\nVery early in April, and tolerably early in the day,\\nthe two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set\\nout from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,\\non the road.  For the convenience of Charlotte and her child,\\nthey were to be more than two days on their journey,\\nand Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon,\\nwas to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\\n\\nMarianne, few as had been her hours of comfort\\nin London, and eager as she had long been to quit it,\\ncould not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to\\nthe house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\\nthose hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby,\\nwhich were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.\\nNor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained,\\nbusy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE\\ncould have no share, without shedding many tears.\\n\\nElinor\\'s satisfaction, at the moment of removal,\\nwas more positive.  She had no such object for her lingering\\nthoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom\\nit would give her a moment\\'s regret to be divided for ever,\\nshe was pleased to be free herself from the persecution\\nof Lucy\\'s friendship, she was grateful for bringing\\nher sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage,\\nand she looked forward with hope to what a few months\\nof tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring\\nMarianne\\'s peace of mind, and confirming her own.\\n\\nTheir journey was safely performed.  The second\\nday brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited,\\ncounty of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns\\nin Marianne\\'s imagination; and in the forenoon of the third\\nthey drove up to Cleveland.\\n\\nCleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,\\nsituated on a sloping lawn.  It had no park, but the\\npleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like\\nevery other place of the same degree of importance,\\nit had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk,\\na road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,\\nled to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber,\\nthe house itself was under the guardianship of the fir,\\nthe mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of\\nthem altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,\\nshut out the offices.\\n\\nMarianne entered the house with a heart swelling\\nwith emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty\\nmiles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;\\nand before she had been five minutes within its walls,\\nwhile the others were busily helping Charlotte to show\\nher child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again,\\nstealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just\\nbeginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence;\\nwhere, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over\\na wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly\\nrest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon,\\nand fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen.\\n\\nIn such moments of precious, invaluable misery,\\nshe rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland;\\nand as she returned by a different circuit to the house,\\nfeeling all the happy privilege of country liberty,\\nof wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude,\\nshe resolved to spend almost every hour of every day\\nwhile she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of\\nsuch solitary rambles.\\n\\nShe returned just in time to join the others\\nas they quitted the house, on an excursion through its\\nmore immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was\\neasily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden,\\nexamining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the\\ngardener\\'s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through\\nthe green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,\\nunwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,\\nraised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her\\npoultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her\\ndairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being\\nstolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\\nyoung brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\\n\\nThe morning was fine and dry, and Marianne,\\nin her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated\\nfor any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland.\\nWith great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented\\nby a settled rain from going out again after dinner.\\nShe had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple,\\nand perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely\\ncold or damp would not have deterred her from it;\\nbut a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry\\nor pleasant weather for walking.\\n\\nTheir party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.\\nMrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work;\\nthey talked of the friends they had left behind,\\narranged Lady Middleton\\'s engagements, and wondered\\nwhether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\\nthan Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned\\nin it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had\\nthe knack of finding her way in every house to the library,\\nhowever it might be avoided by the family in general,\\nsoon procured herself a book.\\n\\nNothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer\\'s side that constant\\nand friendly good humour could do, to make them feel\\nthemselves welcome.  The openness and heartiness of her\\nmanner more than atoned for that want of recollection\\nand elegance which made her often deficient in the forms\\nof politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty\\na face, was engaging; her folly, though evident\\nwas not disgusting, because it was not conceited;\\nand Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very\\nlate dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,\\nand a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a\\nlong morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.\\n\\nElinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that\\nlittle had seen so much variety in his address to her\\nsister and herself, that she knew not what to expect\\nto find him in his own family.  She found him, however,\\nperfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother;\\nshe found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,\\nand only prevented from being so always, by too great\\nan aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people\\nin general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings\\nand Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits,\\nthey were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive,\\nwith no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.\\nHe was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;\\nfond of his child, though affecting to slight it;\\nand idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought\\nto have been devoted to business.  She liked him, however,\\nupon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in\\nher heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--\\nnot sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism,\\nhis selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency\\non the remembrance of Edward\\'s generous temper, simple taste,\\nand diffident feelings.\\n\\nOf Edward, or at least of some of his concerns,\\nshe now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,\\nwho had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who,\\ntreating her at once as the disinterested friend\\nof Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,\\ntalked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford,\\ndescribed its deficiencies, and told her what he meant\\nto do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour\\nto her in this, as well as in every other particular,\\nhis open pleasure in meeting her after an absence\\nof only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,\\nand his deference for her opinion, might very well\\njustify Mrs. Jennings\\'s persuasion of his attachment,\\nand would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,\\nas from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite,\\nto make her suspect it herself.  But as it was,\\nsuch a notion had scarcely ever entered her head,\\nexcept by Mrs. Jennings\\'s suggestion; and she could\\nnot help believing herself the nicest observer of the\\ntwo;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought\\nonly of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious\\nsolicitude on Marianne\\'s feeling, in her head and throat,\\nthe beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\\nentirely escaped the latter lady\\'s observation;--SHE could\\ndiscover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm\\nof a lover.\\n\\nTwo delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth\\nevenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel\\nof the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially\\nin the most distant parts of them, where there was something\\nmore of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were\\nthe oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\\nhad--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting\\nin her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold\\nso violent as, though for a day or two trifled with\\nor denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on\\nthe concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\\nPrescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual,\\nwere all declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain\\nin her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night\\'s\\nrest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty\\nthat Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed,\\nto try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 43\\n\\n\\nMarianne got up the next morning at her usual time;\\nto every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to\\nprove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.\\nBut a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire\\nwith a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,\\nor in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak\\nmuch in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,\\nshe went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel\\nBrandon was only astonished at her sister\\'s composure,\\nwho, though attending and nursing her the whole day,\\nagainst Marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines\\non her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty\\nand efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.\\n\\nA very restless and feverish night, however,\\ndisappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,\\nafter persisting in rising, confessed herself unable\\nto sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,\\nElinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings\\'s advice,\\nof sending for the Palmers\\' apothecary.\\n\\nHe came, examined his patient, and though encouraging\\nMiss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore\\nher sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder\\nto have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word \"infection\"\\nto pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,\\non her baby\\'s account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\\nfrom the first to think Marianne\\'s complaint more serious\\nthan Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris\\'s report,\\nand confirming Charlotte\\'s fears and caution, urged the\\nnecessity of her immediate removal with her infant;\\nand Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,\\nfound the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great\\nto be withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;\\nand within an hour after Mr. Harris\\'s arrival, she set off,\\nwith her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a\\nnear relation of Mr. Palmer\\'s, who lived a few miles\\non the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,\\nat her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;\\nand whither she was almost equally urgent with her\\nmother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings, however, with a\\nkindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,\\ndeclared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland\\nas long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\\nby her own attentive care, to supply to her the place\\nof the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her\\non every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,\\ndesirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her\\nbetter experience in nursing, of material use.\\n\\nPoor Marianne, languid and low from the nature\\nof her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,\\ncould no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;\\nand the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,\\nbut for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;\\nfor on that day they were to have begun their journey home;\\nand, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,\\nwere to have taken their mother by surprise on the\\nfollowing forenoon.  The little she said was all in\\nlamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried\\nto raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN\\nreally believed herself, that it would be a very short one.\\n\\nThe next day produced little or no alteration in the\\nstate of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,\\nexcept that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.\\nTheir party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,\\nthough very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\nand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be\\nfrightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last\\nby Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;\\nand while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,\\nwith a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\\nlikewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings\\ninterposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away\\nwhile his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister\\'s\\naccount, would be to deprive them both, she thought,\\nof every comfort; and therefore telling him at once\\nthat his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,\\nthat she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,\\nwhile Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she\\nurged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying\\nthe first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\\nlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nentreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed\\nto feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person\\nso well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.\\n\\nMarianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all\\nthese arrangements.  She knew not that she had been\\nthe means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,\\nin about seven days from the time of their arrival.\\nIt gave her no surprise that she saw nothing\\nof Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,\\nshe never mentioned her name.\\n\\nTwo days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer\\'s departure,\\nand her situation continued, with little variation,\\nthe same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,\\nstill talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood\\nwas equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined\\nvery early in the seizure that Marianne would never\\nget over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly\\nof use in listening to Mrs. Jennings\\'s forebodings,\\nwas not in a state of mind to resist their influence.\\nHe tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different\\njudgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;\\nbut the many hours of each day in which he was left\\nentirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission\\nof every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from\\nhis mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\\n\\nOn the morning of the third day however, the gloomy\\nanticipations of both were almost done away; for when\\nMr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.\\nHer pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable\\nthan on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every\\npleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that\\nin her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own\\njudgment rather than her friend\\'s, in making very light\\nof the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;\\nand almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be\\nable to travel.\\n\\nBut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--\\nTowards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing\\nmore heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.\\nHer sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to\\nattribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\\nof having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully\\nadministering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with\\nsatisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which\\nshe expected the most beneficial effects.  Her sleep,\\nthough not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,\\nlasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe\\nthe result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her\\nduring the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing\\nof any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;\\nher maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\\nherself in the housekeeper\\'s room, and Elinor remained\\nalone with Marianne.\\n\\nThe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;\\nand her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention\\nher continual change of posture, and heard the frequent\\nbut inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,\\nwas almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,\\nwhen Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\\nin the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,\\ncried out,--\\n\\n\"Is mama coming?--\"\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,\\nand assisting Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will\\nbe here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a great way,\\nyou know, from hence to Barton.\"\\n\\n\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,\\nin the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,\\nif she goes by London.\"\\n\\nElinor perceived with alarm that she was not\\nquite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,\\neagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker than ever!\\nand Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm\\nincreased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending\\ninstantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger\\nto Barton for her mother.  To consult with Colonel Brandon\\non the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought\\nwhich immediately followed the resolution of its performance;\\nand as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\\nby her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,\\nwhere she knew he was generally to be found at a much\\nlater hour than the present.\\n\\nIt was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her\\ndifficulties were immediately before him.  Her fears,\\nhe had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--\\nhe listened to them in silent despondence;--but her\\ndifficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness\\nthat seemed to speak the occasion, and the service\\npre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the\\nmessenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  Elinor made no\\nresistance that was not easily overcome.  She thanked him\\nwith brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went\\nto hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and\\nan order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines\\nto her mother.\\n\\nThe comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel\\nBrandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully\\nwas it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,\\nwhose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might\\nsoothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD\\nbe lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\\nwould lessen it.\\n\\nHE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all\\nthe firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary\\narrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated\\nwith exactness the time in which she might look for\\nhis return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.\\nThe horses arrived, even before they were expected,\\nand Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look\\nof solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,\\nhurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve\\no\\'clock, and she returned to her sister\\'s apartment to wait\\nfor the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her\\nthe rest of the night.  It was a night of almost equal\\nsuffering to both.  Hour after hour passed away in sleepless\\npain and delirium on Marianne\\'s side, and in the most\\ncruel anxiety on Elinor\\'s, before Mr. Harris appeared.\\nHer apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all\\nher former security; and the servant who sat up with her,\\nfor she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,\\nonly tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress\\nhad always thought.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s ideas were still, at intervals,\\nfixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she\\nmentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of\\npoor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled\\nwith so many days of illness, and wretched for some\\nimmediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon\\nbe in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,\\nand pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving\\ntoo late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\\n\\nShe was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,\\nor if HE could not come, for some other advice,\\nwhen the former--but not till after five o\\'clock--arrived.\\nHis opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,\\nfor though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\\nalteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger\\nto be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh\\nmode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,\\nin a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.  He promised\\nto call again in the course of three or four hours,\\nand left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\\ncomposed than he had found them.\\n\\nWith strong concern, and with many reproaches for not\\nbeing called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the\\nmorning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,\\nnow with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of\\nthe event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\\nher conviction of her sister\\'s danger would not allow her\\nto offer the comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.\\nThe rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,\\nso lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested\\nperson with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings\\'s compassion\\nshe had other claims.  She had been for three months\\nher companion, was still under her care, and she was\\nknown to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.\\nThe distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,\\nwas before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\\nconsidered that Marianne might probably be to HER what\\nCharlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings\\nwas very sincere.\\n\\nMr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--\\nbut he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the\\nlast would produce.  His medicines had failed;--the fever\\nwas unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more\\nherself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching all,\\nand more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call\\nin further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had\\nstill something more to try, some more fresh application,\\nof whose success he was as confident as the last, and his\\nvisit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\\nthe ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.\\nShe was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\\nbut she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued\\ntill noon, scarcely stirring from her sister\\'s bed,\\nher thoughts wandering from one image of grief,\\none suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed\\nto the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\\nwho scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger\\nof this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition\\nwhich Marianne\\'s disappointment had brought on.\\nElinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it\\ngave fresh misery to her reflections.\\n\\nAbout noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a\\ndread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,\\neven to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive\\na slight amendment in her sister\\'s pulse;--she waited,\\nwatched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,\\nwith an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,\\nthan all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate\\nher hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,\\nto acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her\\nyoung friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--\\nand Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,\\ntold herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.\\nHope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,\\nshe bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.\\nHalf an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom\\nyet blessed her.  Others even arose to confirm it.\\nHer breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor\\nwith signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on\\nher with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and\\nhope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no\\nmoment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at\\nfour o\\'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\\na recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,\\ngave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\\n\\nMarianne was in every respect materially better,\\nand he declared her entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,\\nperhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her\\nforebodings which had been found in their late alarm,\\nallowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\\nwith unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,\\nthe probability of an entire recovery.\\n\\nElinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a\\ndifferent kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.\\nMarianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her\\ndoting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations\\nof exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--\\nbut it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\\nno smiles.  All within Elinor\\'s breast was satisfaction,\\nsilent and strong.\\n\\nShe continued by the side of her sister, with little\\nintermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,\\nsatisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,\\nsupplying every succour, and watching almost every look and\\nevery breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,\\nin some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--\\nbut when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,\\nthat every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne\\nat six o\\'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\\nappearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\\n\\nThe time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon\\nmight be expected back.  At ten o\\'clock, she trusted,\\nor at least not much later her mother would be relieved\\nfrom the dreadful suspense in which she must now be\\ntravelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\\nless an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress\\nof time which yet kept them in ignorance!\\n\\nAt seven o\\'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep,\\nshe joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.\\nOf breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of\\ndinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--\\nand the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings\\nof content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.\\nMrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,\\nto take some rest before her mother\\'s arrival, and allow HER to\\ntake her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,\\nno capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was\\nnot to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.\\nMrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the\\nsick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts,\\nand retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.\\n\\nThe night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared\\nround the house, and the rain beat against the windows;\\nbut Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.\\nMarianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--\\nthey had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.\\n\\nThe clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,\\nElinor would have been convinced that at that moment\\nshe heard a carriage driving up to the house;\\nand so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite\\nof the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,\\nthat she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and\\nopened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.\\nShe instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.\\nThe flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\\nBy their uncertain light she thought she could discern it\\nto be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the\\nexcess of her poor mother\\'s alarm, gave some explanation\\nto such unexpected rapidity.\\n\\nNever in her life had Elinor found it so difficult\\nto be calm, as at that moment.  The knowledge of what her\\nmother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--\\nof her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and\\nof what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was\\nimpossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done\\nwas to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till\\nshe could leave Mrs. Jennings\\'s maid with her sister,\\nshe hurried down stairs.\\n\\nThe bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along\\nan inner lobby, assured her that they were already\\nin the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she\\nentered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 44\\n\\n\\nElinor, starting back with a look of horror at\\nthe sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart\\nin turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand\\nwas already on the lock, when its action was suspended\\nby his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather\\nof command than supplication,\\n\\n\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--\\nI entreat you to stay.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall NOT stay.\\nYour business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,\\nforgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,\\n\"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,\\nit would not have turned me from the door.  My business\\nis with you, and only you.\"\\n\\n\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement--\"well, sir,--\\nbe quick--and if you can--less violent.\"\\n\\n\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\\n\\nShe hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility\\nof Colonel Brandon\\'s arriving and finding her there,\\ncame across her.  But she had promised to hear him,\\nand her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.\\nAfter a moment\\'s recollection, therefore, concluding that\\nprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would\\nbest promote it, she walked silently towards the table,\\nand sat down.  He took the opposite chair, and for half\\na minute not a word was said by either.\\n\\n\"Pray be quick, sir,\"--said Elinor, impatiently;--\\n\"I have no time to spare.\"\\n\\nHe was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,\\nand seemed not to hear her.\\n\\n\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment\\nafterwards--\"is out of danger.  I heard it from the servant.\\nGod be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?\"\\n\\nElinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with\\nyet greater eagerness.\\n\\n\"For God\\'s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\\n\\n\"We hope she is.\"\\n\\nHe rose up, and walked across the room.\\n\\n\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But\\nsince I AM here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he\\nreturned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--For once,\\nMiss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us\\nbe cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--\\nTell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--\\n\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\\n\\nElinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.\\nShe began to think that be must be in liquor;--the\\nstrangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,\\nseemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression\\nshe immediately rose, saying,\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return\\nto Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--\\nWhatever your business may be with me, will it be better\\nrecollected and explained to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile,\\nand a voice perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk.--\\nA pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was\\nenough to over-set me.\"\\n\\n\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at\\na loss to understand what he would be at.\\n\\n\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o\\'clock,\\nand the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise\\nsince that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough.\"\\n\\nThe steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence\\nof his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever\\nother unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,\\nhe was not brought there by intoxication, she said,\\nafter a moment\\'s recollection,\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly\\nDO--that after what has passed--your coming here in\\nthis manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,\\nrequires a very particular excuse.--What is it,\\nthat you mean by it?\"--\\n\\n\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can,\\nto make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.\\nI mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind\\nof apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,\\nand by convincing you, that though I have been always\\na blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain\\nsomething like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\"\\n\\n\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth\\nwhich brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,\\nand in spite of herself made her think him sincere.\\n\\n\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--\\nfor Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you.\"\\n\\n\"Has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--\\n\"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.\\nBut she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable\\ngrounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\"\\n\\nElinor bowed her assent.\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation\\non her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU\\nmay have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,\\nor what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--\\nPerhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\\nworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.\\nWhen I first became intimate in your family, I had no\\nother intention, no other view in the acquaintance\\nthan to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain\\nin Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\\nYour sister\\'s lovely person and interesting manners\\ncould not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost\\nfrom the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,\\nwhen I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my\\nheart should have been so insensible!  But at first\\nI must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.\\nCareless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,\\ngiving way to feelings which I had always been too much\\nin the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means\\nin my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\\ndesign of returning her affection.\"\\n\\nMiss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him\\nwith the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\\n\\n\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,\\nfor you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.\\nSuch a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--\\nDo not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on\\nthe subject.\"\\n\\n\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,\\n\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,\\nalways in the habit of associating with people of better\\nincome than myself.  Every year since my coming of age,\\nor even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though\\nthe death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;\\nyet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,\\nit had been for some time my intention to re-establish my\\ncircumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  To attach\\nmyself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be\\nthought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--\\nwhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,\\nMiss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting\\nin this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a\\nthought of returning it.--But one thing may be said\\nfor me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,\\nI did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,\\nbecause I did not THEN know what it was to love.\\nBut have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I\\nreally loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,\\nto avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--\\nBut I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,\\nwhich her affection and her society would have deprived\\nof all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\\n\\n\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,\\n\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"\\n\\n\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood\\nsuch tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have\\ndone it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,\\nsincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life\\nwere what I spent with her when I felt my intentions\\nwere strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.\\nEven THEN, however, when fully determined on paying\\nmy addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly\\nto put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\\nfrom an unwillingness to enter into an engagement\\nwhile my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.\\nI will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate\\non the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling\\nto engage my faith where my honour was already bound.\\nThe event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\\nproviding with great circumspection for a possible\\nopportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched\\nfor ever.  At last, however, my resolution was taken,\\nand I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,\\nto justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,\\nand openly assure her of an affection which I had already\\ntaken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the\\ninterim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I\\ncould have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--\\na circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin\\nall my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery\\ntook place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith\\nhad somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some\\ndistant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of\\nher favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not\\nexplain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an\\nheightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular\\nintimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"\\n\\n\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,\\nand hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,\\n\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any\\npart of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess\\nis beyond my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received\\nthe account.  Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge\\nthat her situation and her character ought to have been\\nrespected by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but at\\nthe same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing\\nto urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\\nand because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.\\nIf the violence of her passions, the weakness of her\\nunderstanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.\\nHer affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,\\nwith great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,\\nfor a very short time, had the power of creating any return.\\nI wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured\\nmore than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection\\nfor me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;\\nand whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"--\\n\\n\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate\\ngirl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion\\nof such a subject may well be--your indifference is no\\napology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do not think yourself\\nexcused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding\\non her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\\nYou must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself\\nin Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,\\nalways happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\\n\\n\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly\\nreplied; \"I did not recollect that I had omitted to give\\nher my direction; and common sense might have told her\\nhow to find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\\n\\n\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion\\nmay be guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality\\nof her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing\\nwas against me.  The matter itself I could not deny,\\nand vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was\\npreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my\\nconduct in general, and was moreover discontented with\\nthe very little attention, the very little portion of my\\ntime that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.\\nIn short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I\\nmight have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,\\ngood woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would\\nmarry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally\\ndismissed from her favour and her house.  The night\\nfollowing this affair--I was to go the next morning--\\nwas spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct\\nshould be.  The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.\\nMy affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her\\nattachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh\\nthat dread of poverty, or get the better of those false\\nideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally\\ninclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.\\nI had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,\\nif I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think\\nthat nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.\\nA heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave\\nDevonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;\\nsome apology was therefore necessary for my breaking\\nthis engagement.  But whether I should write this apology,\\nor deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.\\nTo see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted\\nwhether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.\\nIn that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,\\nas the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw\\nher miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping\\nnever to see her again.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor,\\nreproachfully; \"a note would have answered every purpose.--\\nWhy was it necessary to call?\"\\n\\n\"It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear\\nto leave the country in a manner that might lead you,\\nor the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part\\nof what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--\\nand I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,\\nin my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,\\nhowever, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,\\nI found her alone.  You were all gone I do not know where.\\nI had left her only the evening before, so fully,\\nso firmly resolved within my self on doing right!\\nA few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;\\nand I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I\\nwalked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,\\ndelighted with every body!  But in this, our last interview\\nof friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt\\nthat almost took from me the power of dissembling.\\nHer sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told\\nher that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I\\nnever shall forget it--united too with such reliance,\\nsuch confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted\\nrascal I was!\"\\n\\nThey were both silent for a few moments.\\nElinor first spoke.\\n\\n\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently;\\n\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all\\nlikelihood much more than was justified by the future.\\nI cannot think of it.--It won\\'t do.--Then came your dear mother\\nto torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.\\nThank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was miserable.\\nMiss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\ngives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge\\nto myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,\\nthat all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and\\nexultation to me now.  Well, I went, left all that I loved,\\nand went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.\\nMy journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\\nand therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my\\nown reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward\\nevery thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,\\nthe picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\"\\n\\nHe stopped.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him,\\ngrew impatient for his departure, \"and this is all?\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--\\nThat infamous letter--Did she shew it you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"\\n\\n\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did,\\nfor I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--\\nin the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more\\nsimple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--\\nmy feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word\\nwas--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,\\nwere she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.\\nTo know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--\\na thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof\\nwould she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe\\nthey are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure\\nthey are dearer.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart, which had undergone many changes\\nin the course of this extraordinary conversation,\\nwas now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check\\nsuch ideas in her companion as the last.\\n\\n\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that\\nyou are married.  Relate only what in your conscience\\nyou think necessary for me to hear.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that I was still\\nas dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,\\nmany weeks we had been separated, she was as constant\\nin her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy\\nof mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,\\nbecause time and London, business and dissipation,\\nhad in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing\\na fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,\\nand chusing to fancy that she too must have become\\nindifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment\\nas a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders\\nin proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\\novercoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,\\n\\'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.\\'--\\nBut this note made me know myself better.  I felt that\\nshe was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman\\nin the world, and that I was using her infamously.\\nBut every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey\\nand me.  To retreat was impossible.  All that I had to do,\\nwas to avoid you both.  I sent no answer to Marianne,\\nintending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;\\nand for some time I was even determined not to call in\\nBerkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect\\nthe air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,\\nI watched you all safely out of the house one morning,\\nand left my name.\"\\n\\n\"Watched us out of the house!\"\\n\\n\"Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often\\nI watched you, how often I was on the point of falling\\nin with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,\\nas the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did in Bond Street,\\nthere was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse\\nof one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\\nwatchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing\\ndesire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us\\nso long.  I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,\\nas well as everybody else who was likely to prove\\nan acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being\\nin town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,\\nthe first day of his coming, and the day after I had called\\nat Mrs. Jennings\\'s.  He asked me to a party, a dance at his\\nhouse in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement\\nthat you and your sister were to be there, I should have\\nfelt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.\\nThe next morning brought another short note from Marianne--\\nstill affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything\\nthat could make MY conduct most hateful.  I could not\\nanswer it.  I tried--but could not frame a sentence.\\nBut I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.\\nIf you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it\\nwas THEN.  With my head and heart full of your sister,\\nI was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those\\nthree or four weeks were worse than all.  Well, at last,\\nas I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a\\nsweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--\\nMarianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\\nWilloughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand\\nto me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching\\neyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and\\nSophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking\\nall that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over now.--\\nSuch an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;\\nbut not before I had seen Marianne\\'s sweet face as white\\nas death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--\\nthe last manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid\\nsight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,\\nit was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew\\nexactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last\\nin this world.  She was before me, constantly before me,\\nas I travelled, in the same look and hue.\"\\n\\nA short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.\\nWilloughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:\\n\\n\"Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister\\nis certainly better, certainly out of danger?\"\\n\\n\"We are assured of it.\"\\n\\n\"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter;\\nhave you any thing to say about that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister\\nwrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.\\nYou saw what she said.  I was breakfasting at the\\nEllisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought\\nto me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch\\nSophia\\'s eye before it caught mine--and its size,\\nthe elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,\\nimmediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague report had\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady\\nin Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation\\nthe preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,\\nand made her more jealous than ever.  Affecting that air\\nof playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman\\none loves, she opened the letter directly, and read\\nits contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.\\nShe read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could\\nhave borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it\\nmust be appeased.  And, in short--what do you think of my\\nwife\\'s style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--\\ntruly feminine--was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying\\nsuch sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.\\nThe original was all her own--her own happy thoughts\\nand gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were engaged,\\nevery thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am\\ntalking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,\\nher money was necessary to me, and in a situation like\\nmine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.\\nAnd after all, what did it signify to my character\\nin the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language\\nmy answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.\\nMy business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether\\nI did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--\\n\\'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--\\' said I to\\nmyself--\\'I am shut out for ever from their society,\\nthey already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\\nwill only make them think me a blackguard one.\\' Such were\\nmy reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,\\nI copied my wife\\'s words, and parted with the last relics\\nof Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily they were all\\nin my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,\\nand hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,\\nand could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too\\nI had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,\\nwhich was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating\\nvirulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"\\n\\n\"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\"\\nsaid Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself,\\nbetrayed her compassionate emotion; \"you ought not to speak\\nin this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister.\\nYou had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.\\nYour wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,\\nat least.  She must be attached to you, or she would not\\nhave married you.  To treat her with unkindness, to speak\\nof her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I\\nsuppose it a relief to your own conscience.\"\\n\\n\"Do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh.--\\n\"She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no\\nregard for her when we married.--Well, married we were,\\nand came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards\\nreturned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me,\\nMiss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--\\nAm I--be it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion\\nthan I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong.\\nHave I explained away any part of my guilt?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.--\\nYou have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than\\nI had believed you.  You have proved your heart less wicked,\\nmuch less wicked.  But I hardly know--the misery that\\nyou have inflicted--I hardly know what could have made\\nit worse.\"\\n\\n\"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered,\\nwhat I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened\\ntoo in her opinion as well as in yours.  You tell me that\\nshe has forgiven me already.  Let me be able to fancy that\\na better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings,\\nwill draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more\\ngentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery\\nand my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant\\nto her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer\\nto me than ever.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may\\ncomparatively be called, your justification.  But you have\\nnot explained to me the particular reason of your coming now,\\nnor how you heard of her illness.\"\\n\\n\"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir\\nJohn Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for the first\\ntime these two months--he spoke to me.--That he had cut\\nme ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise\\nor resentment.  Now, however, his good-natured, honest,\\nstupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern\\nfor your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling\\nme what he knew ought to--though probably he did not\\nthink it WOULD--vex me horridly.  As bluntly as he could\\nspeak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood\\nwas dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that\\nmorning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger\\nmost imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright,\\n&c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself\\noff as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John.\\nHis heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much\\nof his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,\\nhe almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an\\nold promise about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing\\nthat your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me\\nthe greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me\\nin her latest moments--for how could I tell what horrid\\nprojects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I\\nwas sure would represent me as capable of any thing--\\nWhat I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made,\\nand at eight o\\'clock this morning I was in my carriage.\\nNow you know all.\"\\n\\nElinor made no answer.  Her thoughts were silently fixed\\non the irreparable injury which too early an independence\\nand its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury,\\nhad made in the mind, the character, the happiness,\\nof a man who, to every advantage of person and talents,\\nunited a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\\nfeeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him\\nextravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him\\ncold-hearted and selfish.  Vanity, while seeking its own\\nguilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved\\nhim in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least\\nits offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.\\nEach faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led\\nhim likewise to punishment.  The attachment, from which\\nagainst honour, against feeling, against every better interest\\nhe had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,\\ngoverned every thought; and the connection, for the sake\\nof which he had, with little scruple, left her sister\\nto misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness\\nto himself of a far more incurable nature.  From a reverie\\nof this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes\\nby Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least\\nequally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--\\n\\n\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going back to town?\"\\n\\n\"No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there;\\nfrom thence to town in a day or two.  Good bye.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give\\nhim hers\\'s;--he pressed it with affection.\\n\\n\"And you DO think something better of me than\\nyou did?\"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against\\nthe mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.\\n\\nElinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave,\\npitied, wished him well--was even interested in his\\nhappiness--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour\\nmost likely to promote it.  His answer was not very encouraging.\\n\\n\"As to that,\" said he, \"I must rub through the world\\nas well as I can.  Domestic happiness is out of the question.\\nIf, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel\\nan interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it\\nmay put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to\\nlive for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.\\nWere I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\"\\n\\nElinor stopped him with a reproof.\\n\\n\"Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye. I shall\\nnow go away and live in dread of one event.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Your sister\\'s marriage.\"\\n\\n\"You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost\\nto you than she is now.\"\\n\\n\"But she will be gained by some one else.  And if\\nthat some one should be the very he whom, of all others,\\nI could least bear--but I will not stay to rob myself\\nof all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing\\nthat where I have most injured I can least forgive.\\nGood bye,--God bless you!\"\\n\\nAnd with these words, he almost ran out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 45\\n\\n\\nElinor, for some time after he left her, for some time\\neven after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained\\ntoo much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in\\nthemselves, but of which sadness was the general result,\\nto think even of her sister.\\n\\nWilloughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had\\nabhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite\\nof all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration\\nfor the sufferings produced by them, which made her\\nthink of him as now separated for ever from her family,\\nwith a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she\\nsoon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to\\nhis merits.  She felt that his influence over her mind\\nwas heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason\\nto have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\\nthat open, affectionate, and lively manner which it\\nwas no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love\\nfor Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.\\nBut she felt that it was so, long, long before she could\\nfeel his influence less.\\n\\nWhen at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne,\\nshe found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet\\na sleep to the extent of her hopes.  Elinor\\'s heart was full.\\nThe past, the present, the future, Willoughby\\'s visit,\\nMarianne\\'s safety, and her mother\\'s expected arrival,\\nthrew her altogether into an agitation of spirits\\nwhich kept off every indication of fatigue, and made\\nher only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.\\nShort was the time, however, in which that fear could\\naffect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby\\'s\\nleaving the house, she was again called down stairs\\nby the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her\\nmother from every unnecessary moment\\'s horrible suspense,\\nshe ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward\\ndoor just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the\\nhouse had produced almost the conviction of Marianne\\'s\\nbeing no more, had no voice to inquire after her,\\nno voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for\\nsalutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--\\nand her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,\\nwas in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she\\nhad been before by her fears.  She was supported into\\nthe drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--\\nand there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\\nto speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her\\nat intervals to press Colonel Brandon\\'s hand, with a look\\nwhich spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction\\nof his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.\\nHe shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.\\n\\nAs soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,\\nto see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she\\nwas with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever\\nby absence, unhappiness, and danger.  Elinor\\'s delight,\\nas she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked\\nby an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--\\nbut Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,\\nwhen the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,\\nsatisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious\\nof being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the\\nsilence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.\\nMrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,\\nin compliance with her mother\\'s entreaty, went to bed.\\nBut the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,\\nand many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to\\nmake requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.\\nWilloughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now allowed\\nherself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she\\nwould not but have heard his vindication for the world,\\nand now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him\\nso harshly before.  But her promise of relating it to her\\nsister was invariably painful.  She dreaded the performance\\nof it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;\\ndoubted whether after such an explanation she could ever\\nbe happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby\\na widower.  Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,\\nfelt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more\\nthan to his rival\\'s, the reward of her sister was due,\\nand wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby\\'s death.\\n\\nThe shock of Colonel Brandon\\'s errand at Barton had been\\nmuch softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;\\nfor so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she\\nhad already determined to set out for Cleveland on that\\nvery day, without waiting for any further intelligence,\\nand had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\\nthat the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch\\nMargaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her\\nwhere there might be infection.\\n\\nMarianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant\\ncheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s looks and spirits proved\\nher to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of\\nthe happiest women in the world.  Elinor could not hear\\nthe declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes\\nwondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.\\nBut Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account\\nof her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,\\nwas led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only\\nof what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her\\nfrom a danger in which, as she now began to feel,\\nher own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\nattachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--\\nand in her recovery she had yet another source of joy\\nunthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her,\\nas soon as any opportunity of private conference\\nbetween them occurred.\\n\\n\"At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet\\nknow all my happiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.\\nHe has told me so himself.\"\\n\\nHer daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained,\\nsurprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.\\n\\n\"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should\\nwonder at your composure now.  Had I sat down to wish\\nfor any possible good to my family, I should have fixed\\non Colonel Brandon\\'s marrying one of you as the object\\nmost desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most\\nhappy with him of the two.\"\\n\\nElinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so,\\nbecause satisfied that none founded on an impartial\\nconsideration of their age, characters, or feelings,\\ncould be given;--but her mother must always be carried\\naway by her imagination on any interesting subject,\\nand therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n\"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.\\nIt came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may\\nwell believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could\\nnot conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,\\nand he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world\\nnow goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,\\nnot thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible\\nfeelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,\\naffection for Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since\\nthe first moment of seeing her.\"\\n\\nHere, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language,\\nnot the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural\\nembellishments of her mother\\'s active fancy, which fashioned\\nevery thing delightful to her as it chose.\\n\\n\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything\\nthat Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,\\nas more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--\\nhas subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne\\'s\\nunhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and\\nwithout selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could\\nhe have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--\\nsuch openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived\\nin HIM.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon\\'s character,\" said Elinor,\\n\"as an excellent man, is well established.\"\\n\\n\"I know it is\"--replied her mother seriously, \"or\\nafter such a warning, I should be the last to encourage\\nsuch affection, or even to be pleased by it.  But his coming\\nfor me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,\\nis enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"\\n\\n\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest\\non ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,\\nwere humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.\\nTo Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long\\nand intimately known; they equally love and respect him;\\nand even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,\\nis very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,\\nthat if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready\\nas yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing\\nto us in the world.  What answer did you give him?--Did you\\nallow him to hope?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him\\nor to myself.  Marianne might at that moment be dying.\\nBut he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  His was\\nan involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion\\nto a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.\\nYet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite\\novercome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,\\nmy greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;\\nand since our arrival, since our delightful security,\\nI have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\\nencouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time,\\nI tell him, will do everything;--Marianne\\'s heart is\\nnot to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--\\nHis own merits must soon secure it.\"\\n\\n\"To judge from the Colonel\\'s spirits, however,\\nyou have not yet made him equally sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"No.--He thinks Marianne\\'s affection too deeply\\nrooted for any change in it under a great length of time,\\nand even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident\\nof himself to believe, that with such a difference of age\\nand disposition he could ever attach her.  There, however,\\nhe is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond\\nhers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and\\nprinciples fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,\\nis exactly the very one to make your sister happy.\\nAnd his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.\\nMy partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not\\nso handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,\\nthere is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--\\nThere was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby\\'s\\neyes at times, which I did not like.\"\\n\\nElinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,\\nwithout waiting for her assent, continued,\\n\\n\"And his manners, the Colonel\\'s manners are not only\\nmore pleasing to me than Willoughby\\'s ever were, but they\\nare of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching\\nto Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine attention\\nto other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity\\nis much more accordant with her real disposition, than\\nthe liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed\\nof the other.  I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby\\nturned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself\\nthe contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy\\nwith HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"\\n\\nShe paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree\\nwith her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore\\ngave no offence.\\n\\n\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\"\\nadded Mrs. Dashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all\\nprobability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there\\ncertainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,\\nthat would suit us quite as well as our present situation.\"\\n\\nPoor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting\\nher to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.\\n\\n\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know,\\neverybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know\\nnor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be\\na good one.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the entrance of a\\nthird person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over\\nin private, to wish success to her friend, and yet\\nin wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 46\\n\\n\\nMarianne\\'s illness, though weakening in its kind,\\nhad not been long enough to make her recovery slow;\\nand with youth, natural strength, and her mother\\'s presence\\nin aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,\\nwithin four days after the arrival of the latter,\\ninto Mrs. Palmer\\'s dressing-room.  When there, at her own\\nparticular request, for she was impatient to pour forth\\nher thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon\\nwas invited to visit her.\\n\\nHis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered\\nlooks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\\nheld out to him, was such, as, in Elinor\\'s conjecture,\\nmust arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,\\nor the consciousness of its being known to others;\\nand she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable\\nrecurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,\\nbrought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza\\nalready acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,\\nthe sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than\\nher daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,\\nand therefore watching to very different effect,\\nsaw nothing in the Colonel\\'s behaviour but what arose\\nfrom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in\\nthe actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself\\nto think that something more than gratitude already dawned.\\n\\nAt the end of another day or two, Marianne growing\\nvisibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,\\nurged equally by her own and her daughter\\'s wishes,\\nbegan to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER measures\\ndepended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could\\nnot quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods\\' stay; and Colonel\\nBrandon was soon brought, by their united request,\\nto consider his own abode there as equally determinate,\\nif not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nunited request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed\\non to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,\\nfor the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,\\nat the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,\\nwhose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable\\nfor other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure\\nto redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course\\nof a few weeks.\\n\\nThe day of separation and departure arrived;\\nand Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened\\na leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full\\nof respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart\\nfrom a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\\nColonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,\\nwas carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he\\nseemed anxious that she should engross at least half.\\nMrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others\\nwere left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,\\nand feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned\\nto her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\\nfor the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\\nimmediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne\\nbore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.\\nEvery thing that the most zealous affection, the most\\nsolicitous care could do to render her comfortable,\\nwas the office of each watchful companion, and each\\nfound their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness\\nof spirits.  To Elinor, the observation of the latter\\nwas particularly grateful.  She, who had seen her week\\nafter week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish\\nof heart which she had neither courage to speak of,\\nnor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other\\ncould equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,\\nin being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,\\nmust eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.\\n\\nAs they approached Barton, indeed, and entered\\non scenes of which every field and every tree brought\\nsome peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent\\nand thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,\\nsat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,\\nElinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,\\nas she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she\\nhad been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural\\nin itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,\\nand in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the\\nwhole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction\\nof a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner\\nhad they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne\\nturned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,\\nas if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\\nof every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\\nbe connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed\\nat cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,\\nit never passed away without the atonement of a smile.\\nAfter dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;\\nbut the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,\\nprocured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\\nfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\nin his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,\\nput the music aside, and after running over the keys\\nfor a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,\\nand closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness\\nas she did so, that she should in future practice much.\\n\\nThe next morning produced no abatement in these\\nhappy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a mind and body\\nalike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with\\nmore genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\\nMargaret\\'s return, and talking of the dear family party\\nwhich would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits\\nand cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.\\n\\n\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered\\nmy strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together\\nevery day.  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,\\nand see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John\\'s\\nnew plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\\nand we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,\\nand try to trace its foundations as far as we are told\\nthey once reached.  I know we shall be happy.  I know\\nthe summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to be\\nlater in rising than six, and from that time till dinner\\nI shall divide every moment between music and reading.\\nI have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course\\nof serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,\\nto be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.\\nBut there are many works well worth reading at the Park;\\nand there are others of more modern production which I\\nknow I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six\\nhours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month\\na great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.\"\\n\\nElinor honoured her for a plan which originated\\nso nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager\\nfancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid\\nindolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing\\nexcess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous\\nself-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,\\nand feared she had that to communicate which might again\\nunsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time\\nthis fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  Willing therefore\\nto delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her\\nsister\\'s health were more secure, before she appointed it.\\nBut the resolution was made only to be broken.\\n\\nMarianne had been two or three days at home, before\\nthe weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself\\nto venture out.  But at last a soft, genial morning appeared;\\nsuch as might tempt the daughter\\'s wishes and the\\nmother\\'s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor\\'s arm,\\nwas authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,\\nin the lane before the house.\\n\\nThe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness\\nof Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\\nillness required;--and they had advanced only so far\\nbeyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,\\nthe important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes\\nturned towards it, Marianne calmly said,\\n\\n\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand,\\n\"on that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there\\nI first saw Willoughby.\"\\n\\nHer voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\\n\\n\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain\\non the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\"--\\nhesitatingly it was said.--\"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk\\nof it now, I hope, as I ought to do.\"--\\n\\nElinor tenderly invited her to be open.\\n\\n\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that,\\nas far as HE is concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you\\nof what my feelings have been for him, but what they\\nare NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,\\nif I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS\\nacting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,\\nif I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked\\nas my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story\\nof that unfortunate girl\"--\\n\\nShe stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words\\nas she answered,\\n\\n\"If you could be assured of that, you think you\\nshould be easy.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--\\nfor not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has\\nbeen what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must\\nit make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,\\nbut a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose\\nme to\"--\\n\\n\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account\\nfor his behaviour?\"\\n\\n\"I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him,\\nonly fickle, very, very fickle.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more.  She was debating within herself\\non the eligibility of beginning her story directly,\\nor postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--\\nand they crept on for a few minutes in silence.\\n\\n\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne\\nat last with a sigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections\\nmay be no more unpleasant than my own.  He will suffer\\nenough in them.\"\\n\\n\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\\n\\n\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been;\\nI compare it with yours.\"\\n\\n\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\\n\\n\"They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not,\\nmy dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know\\nyour judgment must censure.  My illness has made me think--\\nIt has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.\\nLong before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly\\nable to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my\\nown behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance\\nwith him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence\\ntowards myself, and want of kindness to others.\\nI saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,\\nand that my want of fortitude under them had almost led\\nme to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been\\nentirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my\\nown health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\\nHad I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I\\ndid not know my danger till the danger was removed;\\nbut with such feelings as these reflections gave me,\\nI wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness\\nof my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\\nand to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I died,--\\nin what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,\\nmy friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful\\nselfishness of my latter days; who had known all the\\nmurmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR\\nremembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled\\nher!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.\\nWhenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,\\nor some failing indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.\\nThe kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\\nI had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletons,\\nto the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,\\nI had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened\\nagainst their merits, and a temper irritated by their\\nvery attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,\\nlittle as they deserve, I had given less than their due.\\nBut you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged\\nby me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;\\nyet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion\\nthat could benefit you or myself.--Your example was\\nbefore me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate\\nof you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,\\nor lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those\\noffices of general complaisance or particular gratitude\\nwhich you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--\\nnot less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I\\nhad believed you at ease, did I turn away from every\\nexertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow\\nto exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart\\nwhich had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,\\nfor or I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable\\nfor my sake.\"\\n\\nHere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;\\nand Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest\\nto flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support\\nwhich her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.\\nMarianne pressed her hand and replied,\\n\\n\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof.\\nI have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering\\nto it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.\\nThey shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.\\nI shall now live solely for my family.  You, my mother,\\nand Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me;\\nyou will share my affections entirely between you.\\n>From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest\\nincitement to move; and if I do mix in other society,\\nit will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,\\nmy heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities,\\nthe lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.\\nAs for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall\\never forget him, would be idle.  His remembrance can be overcome\\nby no change of circumstances or opinions.  But it shall\\nbe regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,\\nby constant employment.\"\\n\\nShe paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could\\nbut know HIS heart, everything would become easy.\"\\n\\nElinor, who had now been for some time reflecting\\non the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding\\nher narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than\\nat first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection\\ndid nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\\nleading to the fact.\\n\\nShe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address;\\nprepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply\\nand honestly the chief points on which Willoughby\\ngrounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,\\nand softened only his protestations of present regard.\\nMarianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes\\nwere fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter\\nthan even sickness had left them.  A thousand inquiries\\nsprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.\\nShe caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister\\'s, and\\ntears covered her cheeks.\\n\\nElinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home;\\nand till they reached the door of the cottage,\\neasily conjecturing what her curiosity must be\\nthough no question was suffered to speak it, talked of\\nnothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together;\\nand was carefully minute in every particular of speech\\nand look, where minuteness could be safely indulged.\\nAs soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss\\nof gratitude and these two words just articulate through\\nher tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and\\nwalked slowly up stairs.  Elinor would not attempt\\nto disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;\\nand with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,\\nand a resolution of reviving the subject again,\\nshould Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour\\nto fulfill her parting injunction.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 47\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication\\nof her former favourite.  She rejoiced in his being\\ncleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was\\nsorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the feelings\\nof the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore\\nhim with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished,\\nto Marianne.  Nothing could do away the knowledge\\nof what the latter had suffered through his means,\\nnor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.\\nNothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,\\nnor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.\\n\\nHad Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby\\'s\\nstory from himself--had she witnessed his distress,\\nand been under the influence of his countenance and his\\nmanner, it is probable that her compassion would have\\nbeen greater.  But it was neither in Elinor\\'s power,\\nnor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her\\nretailed explanation, as had at first been called forth\\nin herself.  Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,\\nand sobered her own opinion of Willoughby\\'s deserts;--\\nshe wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,\\nand lay open such facts as were really due to his character,\\nwithout any embellishment of tenderness to lead the\\nfancy astray.\\n\\nIn the evening, when they were all three together,\\nMarianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--\\nbut that it was not without an effort, the restless,\\nunquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time\\npreviously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--\\nand her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.\\n\\n\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see\\nevery thing--as you can desire me to do.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly\\nwith soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished\\nto hear her sister\\'s unbiased opinion, by an eager sign,\\nengaged her silence.  Marianne slowly continued--\\n\\n\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told\\nme this morning--I have now heard exactly what I\\nwished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice was lost;\\nbut recovering herself, she added, and with greater\\ncalmness than before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied,\\nI wish for no change.  I never could have been happy\\nwith him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must\\nhave known, all this.--I should have had no confidence,\\nno esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother.\\n\"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one\\nwho so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,\\nand the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart\\nto be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her\\nsensitive conscience, would have felt all that the\\nconscience of her husband ought to have felt.\"\\n\\nMarianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"\\n\\n\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as\\na good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;\\nand I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only\\nin this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough\\nto be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\\nin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which\\nyou would have been poorly supported by an affection,\\non his side, much less certain.  Had you married,\\nyou must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is\\nacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares\\nthat self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.\\nHis demands and your inexperience together, on a small,\\nvery small income, must have brought on distresses which\\nwould not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been\\nentirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense\\nof honour and honesty would have led you, I know,\\nwhen aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy\\nthat would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long\\nas your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,\\nyou might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--\\nand how little could the utmost of your single management\\ndo to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--\\nBeyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,\\nto abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead\\nof prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,\\nyou would have lessened your own influence on his heart,\\nand made him regret the connection which had involved him\\nin such difficulties?\"\\n\\nMarianne\\'s lips quivered, and she repeated the word\\n\"Selfish?\" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think\\nhim selfish?\"\\n\\n\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been\\ngrounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness which first\\nmade him sport with your affections; which afterwards,\\nwhen his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\\nof it, and which finally carried him from Barton.\\nHis own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,\\nhis ruling principle.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\"\\n\\n\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he\\nhas done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds\\nit has not answered towards himself.  It has not made\\nhim happy.  His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he\\nsuffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\\nthan yourself.  But does it follow that had he married you,\\nhe would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have\\nbeen different.  He would then have suffered under the\\npecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,\\nhe now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife\\nof whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would\\nhave been always necessitous--always poor; and probably\\nwould soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts\\nof a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,\\neven to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I\\nhave nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly.\"\\n\\n\"Rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood; \"SHE must be answerable.\"\\n\\nMarianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,\\nsatisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid\\nany survey of the past that might weaken her sister\\'s\\nspirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,\\nimmediately continued,\\n\\n\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from\\nthe whole of the story--that all Willoughby\\'s difficulties\\nhave arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his\\nbehaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime has been the origin\\nof every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"\\n\\nMarianne assented most feelingly to the remark;\\nand her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s injuries and merits, warm as friendship\\nand design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did\\nnot look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\\n\\nElinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two\\nor three following days, that Marianne did not continue\\nto gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution\\nwas unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful\\nand easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect\\nof time upon her health.\\n\\nMargaret returned, and the family were again all\\nrestored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;\\nand if not pursuing their usual studies with quite\\nso much vigour as when they first came to Barton,\\nat least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\\n\\nElinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.\\nShe had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,\\nnothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his\\npresent abode.  Some letters had passed between her\\nand her brother, in consequence of Marianne\\'s illness;\\nand in the first of John\\'s, there had been this sentence:--\\n\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no\\nenquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him\\nto be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence\\nof Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name\\nwas not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\\nShe was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of\\nhis measures.\\n\\nTheir man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter\\non business; and when, as he waited at table, he had\\nsatisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event\\nof his errand, this was his voluntary communication--\\n\\n\"I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\\n\\nMarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes\\nupon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her\\nchair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she\\nanswered the servant\\'s inquiry, had intuitively taken\\nthe same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor\\'s\\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment\\nafterwards, alike distressed by Marianne\\'s situation,\\nknew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.\\n\\nThe servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was\\ntaken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,\\nwho, with Mrs. Dashwood\\'s assistance, supported her into\\nthe other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather better,\\nand her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret\\nand the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still\\nmuch disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason\\nand voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,\\nas to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood\\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion\\nof seeking it.\\n\\n\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"\\n\\n\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning\\nin Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.  They was\\nstopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn,\\nas I went there with a message from Sally at the Park\\nto her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened\\nto look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly\\nit was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat,\\nand she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,\\nma\\'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne,\\nand bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars\\'s,\\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they\\nwas they had not time to come on and see you, but they was\\nin a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further\\ndown for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,\\nthey\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"\\n\\n\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. She smiled, and said how she\\nhad changed her name since she was in these parts.\\nShe was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,\\nand very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\"\\n\\n\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, I just see him leaning back in it,\\nbut he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much\\nfor talking.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart could easily account for his not\\nputting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably\\nfound the same explanation.\\n\\n\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, only they two.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know where they came from?\"\\n\\n\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--\\nMrs. Ferrars told me.\"\\n\\n\"And are they going farther westward?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon\\nbe back again, and then they\\'d be sure and call here.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;\\nbut Elinor knew better than to expect them.\\nShe recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was\\nvery confident that Edward would never come near them.\\nShe observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they\\nwere probably going down to Mr. Pratt\\'s, near Plymouth.\\n\\nThomas\\'s intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked\\nas if she wished to hear more.\\n\\n\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but I\\ncould not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well;\\nand to my mind she was always a very handsome young\\nlady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood could think of no other question,\\nand Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,\\nwere soon afterwards dismissed.  Marianne had already sent\\nto say, that she should eat nothing more.  Mrs. Dashwood\\'s\\nand Elinor\\'s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much\\nuneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,\\nso much reason as they had often had to be careless\\nof their meals, she had never been obliged to go without\\nher dinner before.\\n\\nWhen the dessert and the wine were arranged,\\nand Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves,\\nthey remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness\\nand silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark,\\nand ventured not to offer consolation.  She now found\\nthat she had erred in relying on Elinor\\'s representation\\nof herself; and justly concluded that every thing\\nhad been expressly softened at the time, to spare her\\nfrom an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then\\nhad suffered for Marianne.  She found that she had been\\nmisled by the careful, the considerate attention of\\nher daughter, to think the attachment, which once she\\nhad so well understood, much slighter in reality, than\\nshe had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved\\nto be.  She feared that under this persuasion she had\\nbeen unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--\\nthat Marianne\\'s affliction, because more acknowledged,\\nmore immediately before her, had too much engrossed\\nher tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor\\nshe might have a daughter suffering almost as much,\\ncertainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 48\\n\\n\\nElinor now found the difference between the expectation\\nof an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told\\nto consider it, and certainty itself.  She now found, that\\nin spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,\\nwhile Edward remained single, that something would occur\\nto prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of\\nhis own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible\\nopportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise\\nto assist the happiness of all.  But he was now married;\\nand she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,\\nwhich so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.\\n\\nThat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined)\\nhe could be in orders, and consequently before he could\\nbe in possession of the living, surprised her a little\\nat first.  But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,\\nin her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,\\nshould overlook every thing but the risk of delay.\\nThey were married, married in town, and now hastening\\ndown to her uncle\\'s.  What had Edward felt on being within\\nfour miles from Barton, on seeing her mother\\'s servant,\\non hearing Lucy\\'s message!\\n\\nThey would soon, she supposed, be settled at\\nDelaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much\\nconspired to give her an interest; which she wished\\nto be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.\\nShe saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw\\nin Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once\\na desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,\\nand ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--\\npursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the\\nfavour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every\\nwealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw,\\nnor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing\\npleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.\\n\\nElinor flattered herself that some one of their\\nconnections in London would write to them to announce\\nthe event, and give farther particulars,--but day after\\nday passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.\\nThough uncertain that any one were to blame, she found\\nfault with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless\\nor indolent.\\n\\n\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma\\'am?\"\\nwas an inquiry which sprung from the impatience\\nof her mind to have something going on.\\n\\n\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather\\nexpect to see, than to hear from him again.  I earnestly\\npressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised\\nto see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\\n\\nThis was gaining something, something to look forward to.\\nColonel Brandon must have some information to give.\\n\\nScarcely had she so determined it, when the figure\\nof a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.\\nHe stopt at their gate.  It was a gentleman, it\\nwas Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;\\nand she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was\\nNOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.\\nWere it possible, she must say it must be Edward.\\nShe looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she could not be\\nmistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.\\n\"He comes from Mr. Pratt\\'s purposely to see us.  I WILL be\\ncalm; I WILL be mistress of myself.\"\\n\\nIn a moment she perceived that the others were likewise\\naware of the mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne\\nchange colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper\\na few sentences to each other.  She would have given\\nthe world to be able to speak--and to make them understand\\nthat she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear\\nin their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,\\nand was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.\\n\\nNot a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited\\nin silence for the appearance of their visitor.\\nHis footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment\\nhe was in the passage, and in another he was before them.\\n\\nHis countenance, as he entered the room, was not\\ntoo happy, even for Elinor.  His complexion was white\\nwith agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his\\nreception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\\nMrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,\\nto the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant\\nin the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,\\nmet with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,\\nand wished him joy.\\n\\nHe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.\\nElinor\\'s lips had moved with her mother\\'s, and, when the\\nmoment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken\\nhands with him too.  But it was then too late, and with a\\ncountenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\\nand talked of the weather.\\n\\nMarianne had retreated as much as possible\\nout of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret,\\nunderstanding some part, but not the whole of the case,\\nthought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore\\ntook a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained\\na strict silence.\\n\\nWhen Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness\\nof the season, a very awful pause took place.  It was put\\nan end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he\\nhad left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a hurried manner,\\nhe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\nAnother pause.\\n\\nElinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing\\nthe sound of her own voice, now said,\\n\\n\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"\\n\\n\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise.--\\n\"No, my mother is in town.\"\\n\\n\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from\\nthe table, \"to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.\"\\n\\nShe dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both\\nturned their eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed,\\nlooked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs.\\nROBERT Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her\\nmother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though\\nElinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him\\nwith the same impatient wonder.  He rose from his seat,\\nand walked to the window, apparently from not knowing\\nwhat to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,\\nand while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting\\nthe latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,\\n\\n\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard\\nthat my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to\\nMiss Lucy Steele.\"\\n\\nHis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment\\nby all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over\\nher work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly\\nknow where she was.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week,\\nand are now at Dawlish.\"\\n\\nElinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran\\nout of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,\\nburst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would\\nnever cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any where,\\nrather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--\\nor even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards\\nhe fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,\\nno affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,\\nand at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,\\nand walked out towards the village--leaving the others\\nin the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change\\nin his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity\\nwhich they had no means of lessening but by their\\nown conjectures.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 49\\n\\n\\nUnaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his\\nrelease might appear to the whole family, it was certain\\nthat Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would\\nbe employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after\\nexperiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement,\\ncontracted without his mother\\'s consent, as he had already\\ndone for more than four years, nothing less could be expected\\nof him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction\\nof another.\\n\\nHis errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.\\nIt was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering\\nthat he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,\\nit might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable\\nin the present case as he really did, so much in need of\\nencouragement and fresh air.\\n\\nHow soon he had walked himself into the proper\\nresolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising\\nit occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,\\nand how he was received, need not be particularly told.\\nThis only need be said;--that when they all sat down to\\ntable at four o\\'clock, about three hours after his arrival,\\nhe had secured his lady, engaged her mother\\'s consent,\\nand was not only in the rapturous profession of\\nthe lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,\\none of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was\\nmore than commonly joyful.  He had more than the ordinary\\ntriumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise\\nhis spirits.  He was released without any reproach\\nto himself, from an entanglement which had long formed\\nhis misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--\\nand elevated at once to that security with another,\\nwhich he must have thought of almost with despair,\\nas soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.\\nHe was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from\\nmisery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken\\nin such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,\\nas his friends had never witnessed in him before.\\n\\nHis heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,\\nall its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment\\nto Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.\\n\\n\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\"\\nsaid he, \"the consequence of ignorance of the world--\\nand want of employment.  Had my brother given me\\nsome active profession when I was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure,\\nit would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple\\nwith what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable\\npreference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit,\\nany object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\\nfrom her for a few months, I should very soon have\\noutgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing\\nmore with the world, as in such case I must have done.\\nBut instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any\\nprofession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself,\\nI returned home to be completely idle; and for the first\\ntwelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me;\\nfor I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen.\\nI had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy\\nmyself in love; and as my mother did not make my home\\nin every respect comfortable, as I had no friend,\\nno companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance,\\nit was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,\\nwhere I always felt myself at home, and was always sure\\nof a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part\\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared\\neverything that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty\\ntoo--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little\\nof other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see\\nno defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I hope,\\nfoolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since\\nin every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural\\nor an inexcusable piece of folly.\"\\n\\nThe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds\\nand the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as\\npromised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.\\nMrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how\\nto love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough\\nthankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,\\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\nconversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,\\nthe sight and society of both.\\n\\nMarianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.\\nComparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,\\nthough sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to\\ngive her neither spirits nor language.\\n\\nBut Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From\\nthe moment of learning that Lucy was married to another,\\nthat Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying\\nthe hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every\\nthing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment\\nhad passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\\nremoved, compared her situation with what so lately it\\nhad been,--saw him honourably released from his former\\nengagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release,\\nto address herself and declare an affection as tender,\\nas constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she\\nwas oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;--\\nand happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily\\nfamiliarized with any change for the better, it required\\nseveral hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any\\ndegree of tranquillity to her heart.\\n\\nEdward was now fixed at the cottage at least for\\na week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him,\\nit was impossible that less than a week should be given\\nup to the enjoyment of Elinor\\'s company, or suffice\\nto say half that was to be said of the past, the present,\\nand the future;--for though a very few hours spent in\\nthe hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more\\nsubjects than can really be in common between any two\\nrational creatures, yet with lovers it is different.\\nBetween THEM no subject is finished, no communication\\nis even made, till it has been made at least twenty\\ntimes over.\\n\\nLucy\\'s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder\\namong them all, formed of course one of the earliest\\ndiscussions of the lovers;--and Elinor\\'s particular knowledge\\nof each party made it appear to her in every view, as one\\nof the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances\\nshe had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,\\nand by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry\\na girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak\\nwithout any admiration,--a girl too already engaged\\nto his brother, and on whose account that brother had been\\nthrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension\\nto make out.  To her own heart it was a delightful affair,\\nto her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but\\nto her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\\n\\nEdward could only attempt an explanation by supposing,\\nthat, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity\\nof the one had been so worked on by the flattery\\nof the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.\\nElinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother\\'s\\naffairs might have done, if applied to in time.\\nShe repeated it to Edward.\\n\\n\"THAT was exactly like Robert,\"--was his immediate\\nobservation.--\"And THAT,\" he presently added, \"might\\nperhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between\\nthem first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour.\\nOther designs might afterward arise.\"\\n\\nHow long it had been carrying on between them,\\nhowever, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out;\\nfor at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since\\nhis quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her\\nbut from herself, and her letters to the very last were\\nneither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.\\nNot the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred\\nto prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it\\nburst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been\\nfor some time, he believed, half stupified between\\nthe wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.\\nHe put the letter into Elinor\\'s hands.\\n\\n     \"DEAR SIR,\\n\\n     \"Being very sure I have long lost your affections,\\n     I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own\\n     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with\\n     him as I once used to think I might be with you;\\n     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was\\n     another\\'s.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,\\n     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always\\n     good friends, as our near relationship now makes\\n     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,\\n     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any\\n     ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections\\n     entirely, and as we could not live without one\\n     another, we are just returned from the altar, and\\n     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which\\n     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\\n     but thought I would first trouble you with these\\n     few lines, and shall always remain,\\n\\n     \"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\\n                                        \"LUCY FERRARS.\\n\\n     \"I have burnt all your letters, and will return\\n     your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy\\n     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very\\n     welcome to keep.\"\\n\\nElinor read and returned it without any comment.\\n\\n\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\"\\nsaid Edward.--\"For worlds would not I have had a letter\\nof hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it\\nis bad enough, but in a wife!--how I have blushed over\\nthe pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that\\nsince the first half year of our foolish--business--this\\nis the only letter I ever received from her, of which\\nthe substance made me any amends for the defect of the style.\"\\n\\n\"However it may have come about,\" said Elinor,\\nafter a pause,--\"they are certainly married.  And your mother\\nhas brought on herself a most appropriate punishment.\\nThe independence she settled on Robert, through resentment\\nagainst you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;\\nand she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\\na-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the\\nother for intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt,\\nI suppose, by Robert\\'s marrying Lucy, than she would have\\nbeen by your marrying her.\"\\n\\n\"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always\\nwas her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it,\\nand on the same principle will forgive him much sooner.\"\\n\\nIn what state the affair stood at present between them,\\nEdward knew not, for no communication with any of his family\\nhad yet been attempted by him.  He had quitted Oxford\\nwithin four and twenty hours after Lucy\\'s letter arrived,\\nand with only one object before him, the nearest road\\nto Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct,\\nwith which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.\\nHe could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\nMiss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate,\\nit is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with\\nwhich he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite\\nof the modesty with which he rated his own deserts,\\nand the politeness with which he talked of his doubts,\\nhe did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception.\\nIt was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he\\nsaid it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject\\na twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination\\nof husbands and wives.\\n\\nThat Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off\\nwith a flourish of malice against him in her message\\nby Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself,\\nnow thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no\\nscruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness\\nof wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\\neven before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her\\nignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--\\nthey had been equally imputed, by him, to her want\\nof education; and till her last letter reached him,\\nhe had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.\\nNothing but such a persuasion could have prevented\\nhis putting an end to an engagement, which, long before\\nthe discovery of it laid him open to his mother\\'s anger,\\nhad been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.\\n\\n\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings,\\nto give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,\\nwhen I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all\\nappearance without a friend in the world to assist me.\\nIn such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing\\nto tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,\\nhow could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted\\non sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing\\nbut the most disinterested affection was her inducement?\\nAnd even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,\\nor what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be\\nfettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,\\nand who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\\nShe could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a\\nliving.\"\\n\\n\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur\\nin your favour; that your own family might in time relent.\\nAnd at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,\\nfor she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination\\nnor her actions.  The connection was certainly a\\nrespectable one, and probably gained her consideration among\\nher friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,\\nit would be better for her to marry YOU than be single.\"\\n\\nEdward was, of course, immediately convinced that\\nnothing could have been more natural than Lucy\\'s conduct,\\nnor more self-evident than the motive of it.\\n\\nElinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold\\nthe imprudence which compliments themselves, for having\\nspent so much time with them at Norland, when he must\\nhave felt his own inconstancy.\\n\\n\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she;\\n\"because--to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations\\nwere all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you\\nwere THEN situated, could never be.\"\\n\\nHe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart,\\nand a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.\\n\\n\"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH\\nwas plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being\\nwith you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was\\nto keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.  I felt\\nthat I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;\\nand till I began to make comparisons between yourself\\nand Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that,\\nI suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,\\nand the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the\\nexpediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger\\nis my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself.\"\\n\\nElinor smiled, and shook her head.\\n\\nEdward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon\\'s\\nbeing expected at the Cottage, as he really wished\\nnot only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an\\nopportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\\nhis giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"\\nsaid he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine\\nwere on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven\\nhim for offering.\"\\n\\nNOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet\\nbeen to the place.  But so little interest had be taken\\nin the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,\\ngarden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of\\nthe land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,\\nwho had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon,\\nand heard it with so much attention, as to be entirely\\nmistress of the subject.\\n\\nOne question after this only remained undecided,\\nbetween them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.\\nThey were brought together by mutual affection,\\nwith the warmest approbation of their real friends;\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make\\ntheir happiness certain--and they only wanted something\\nto live upon.  Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor\\none, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could\\ncall their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood\\nshould advance anything; and they were neither of them\\nquite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\\npounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.\\n\\nEdward was not entirely without hopes of some\\nfavourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT\\nhe rested for the residue of their income.  But Elinor\\nhad no such dependence; for since Edward would still\\nbe unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself\\nhad been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars\\'s flattering language\\nas only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,\\nshe feared that Robert\\'s offence would serve no other\\npurpose than to enrich Fanny.\\n\\nAbout four days after Edward\\'s arrival Colonel\\nBrandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood\\'s satisfaction,\\nand to give her the dignity of having, for the first time\\nsince her living at Barton, more company with her than\\nher house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore\\nwalked every night to his old quarters at the Park;\\nfrom whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough\\nto interrupt the lovers\\' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.\\n\\nA three weeks\\' residence at Delaford, where,\\nin his evening hours at least, he had little to do\\nbut to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six\\nand seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne\\'s looks,\\nall the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement\\nof her mother\\'s language, to make it cheerful.\\nAmong such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.\\nNo rumour of Lucy\\'s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his\\nvisit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.\\nEvery thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,\\nand he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done\\nfor Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest\\nof Elinor.\\n\\nIt would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced\\nin the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each\\nother\\'s acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise.\\nTheir resemblance in good principles and good sense,\\nin disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship,\\nwithout any other attraction; but their being in love\\nwith two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,\\nmade that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time\\nand judgment.\\n\\nThe letters from town, which a few days before would\\nhave made every nerve in Elinor\\'s body thrill with transport,\\nnow arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.\\nMrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her\\nhonest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth\\nher compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,\\nhad quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,\\nby all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--\\n\"I do think,\" she continued, \"nothing was ever carried\\non so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called\\nand sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul suspected\\nanything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!\\ncame crying to me the day after, in a great fright\\nfor fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to\\nget to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\\nmoney before she went off to be married, on purpose\\nwe suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not\\nseven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give\\nher five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she\\nthinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,\\nin hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.\\nAnd I must say that Lucy\\'s crossness not to take them\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all.\\nPoor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you\\nmust send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to\\ncomfort him.\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s strains were more solemn.\\nMrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor\\nFanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he\\nconsidered the existence of each, under such a blow,\\nwith grateful wonder.  Robert\\'s offence was unpardonable,\\nbut Lucy\\'s was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were\\never again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,\\nif she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,\\nhis wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,\\nnor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy\\nwith which everything had been carried on between them,\\nwas rationally treated as enormously heightening\\nthe crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred\\nto the others, proper measures would have been taken\\nto prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\\nwith him in regretting that Lucy\\'s engagement with Edward\\nhad not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus\\nbe the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--\\nHe thus continued:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward\\'s name,\\nwhich does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment,\\nnot a line has been received from him on the occasion.\\nPerhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,\\nand I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line\\nto Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter\\nof proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,\\nand by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;\\nfor we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s heart,\\nand that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms\\nwith her children.\"\\n\\nThis paragraph was of some importance to the\\nprospects and conduct of Edward.  It determined him\\nto attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly\\nin the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\\n\\n\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he;\\n\"would they have me beg my mother\\'s pardon for Robert\\'s\\ningratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can\\nmake no submission--I am grown neither humble nor\\npenitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy;\\nbut that would not interest.--I know of no submission\\nthat IS proper for me to make.\"\\n\\n\"You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said Elinor,\\n\"because you have offended;--and I should think you\\nmight NOW venture so far as to profess some concern\\nfor having ever formed the engagement which drew on you\\nyour mother\\'s anger.\"\\n\\nHe agreed that he might.\\n\\n\"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility\\nmay be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement,\\nalmost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first.\"\\n\\nHe had nothing to urge against it, but still\\nresisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;\\nand therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared\\na much greater willingness to make mean concessions\\nby word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,\\ninstead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London,\\nand personally intreat her good offices in his favour.--\\n\"And if they really DO interest themselves,\" said Marianne,\\nin her new character of candour, \"in bringing about\\na reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny\\nare not entirely without merit.\"\\n\\nAfter a visit on Colonel Brandon\\'s side of only three\\nor four days, the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.--\\nThey were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward\\nmight have some personal knowledge of his future home,\\nand assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\nimprovements were needed to it; and from thence,\\nafter staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed\\non his journey to town.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 50\\n\\n\\nAfter a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars,\\njust so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that\\nreproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,\\nthe reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted\\nto her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\\n\\nHer family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.\\nFor many years of her life she had had two sons;\\nbut the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago,\\nhad robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert\\nhad left her for a fortnight without any; and now,\\nby the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\\n\\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live,\\nhowever, he did not feel the continuance of his existence\\nsecure, till he had revealed his present engagement;\\nfor the publication of that circumstance, he feared,\\nmight give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry\\nhim off as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution\\ntherefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with\\nunexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably\\nendeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,\\nby every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton\\nhe would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--\\nand enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton\\nwas the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,\\nwhile Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private\\ngentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,\\nthough perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\\nhe was by no means inclined to be guided by it,\\nshe judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,\\nto submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay\\nas she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent\\nevery suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree\\nof consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\\n\\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting\\ntheir income was next to be considered; and here it\\nplainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,\\nhe was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,\\nnot the smallest objection was made against Edward\\'s taking\\norders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;\\nnor was anything promised either for the present or in future,\\nbeyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.\\n\\nIt was as much, however, as was desired,\\nand more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor;\\nand Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\\n\\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants\\nthus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for\\nafter Edward was in possession of the living, but the\\nreadiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,\\nwith an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,\\nwas making considerable improvements; and after waiting\\nsome time for their completion, after experiencing,\\nas usual, a thousand disappointments and delays\\nfrom the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution\\nof not marrying till every thing was ready, and the\\nceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.\\n\\nThe first month after their marriage was spent\\nwith their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence\\nthey could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,\\nand direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--\\ncould chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s prophecies, though rather jumbled together,\\nwere chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward\\nand his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she\\nfound in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,\\none of the happiest couples in the world.  They had\\nin fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel\\nBrandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for\\ntheir cows.\\n\\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost\\nall their relations and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came\\nto inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\\nof having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at\\nthe expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\\n\\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\"\\nsaid John, as they were walking together one morning before\\nthe gates of Delaford House, \"THAT would be saying too much,\\nfor certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\\nwomen in the world, as it is.  But, I confess, it would\\ngive me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.\\nHis property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I\\nhave not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there\\nis now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,\\nMarianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--\\nyet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to\\nhave them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what\\nmay happen--for, when people are much thrown together,\\nand see little of anybody else--and it will always be\\nin your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--\\nin short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand\\nme.\"--\\n\\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always\\ntreated them with the make-believe of decent affection,\\nthey were never insulted by her real favour and preference.\\nTHAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning\\nof his wife; and it was earned by them before many months\\nhad passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter,\\nwhich had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,\\nwas the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;\\nfor her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,\\nand endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening\\nwas given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\\nto his choice, and re-established him completely in\\nher favour.\\n\\nThe whole of Lucy\\'s behaviour in the affair,\\nand the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held\\nforth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,\\nan unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress\\nmay be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\\nand conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,\\nand privately visited her in Bartlett\\'s Buildings,\\nit was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.\\nHe merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;\\nand as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews\\nwould settle the matter.  In that point, however,\\nand that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him\\nhopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,\\nanother visit, another conversation, was always wanted\\nto produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered\\nin her mind when they parted, which could only be\\nremoved by another half hour\\'s discourse with himself.\\nHis attendance was by this means secured, and the rest\\nfollowed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward,\\nthey came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject\\non which he had always more to say than on any other,\\nand in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\\nto his own; and in short, it became speedily evident\\nto both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.\\nHe was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,\\nand very proud of marrying privately without his\\nmother\\'s consent.  What immediately followed is known.\\nThey passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;\\nfor she had many relations and old acquaintances to\\ncut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--\\nand from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness\\nof Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,\\nwhich, at Lucy\\'s instigation, was adopted.  The forgiveness,\\nat first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;\\nand Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore\\ncould have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\\nlonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct\\nand messages, in self-condemnation for Robert\\'s offence,\\nand gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,\\nprocured her in time the haughty notice which overcame\\nher by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid\\ndegrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\\nLucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert\\nor Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven\\nfor having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,\\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken\\nof as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered,\\nand always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.\\nThey settled in town, received very liberal assistance\\nfrom Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable\\nwith the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies\\nand ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well\\nas the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and\\nLucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which\\nthey all lived together.\\n\\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest\\nson, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what\\nRobert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them\\nstill more.  It was an arrangement, however, justified in\\nits effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever\\nappeared in Robert\\'s style of living or of talking to give\\na suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,\\nas either leaving his brother too little, or bringing\\nhimself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from\\nthe ready discharge of his duties in every particular,\\nfrom an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,\\nhe might be supposed no less contented with his lot,\\nno less free from every wish of an exchange.\\n\\nElinor\\'s marriage divided her as little from her\\nfamily as could well be contrived, without rendering\\nthe cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother\\nand sisters spent much more than half their time with her.\\nMrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;\\nfor her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together\\nwas hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than\\nwhat John had expressed.  It was now her darling object.\\nPrecious as was the company of her daughter to her,\\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant\\nenjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at\\nthe mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.\\nThey each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,\\nand Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward\\nof all.\\n\\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge\\nso intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond\\nattachment to herself, which at last, though long after it\\nwas observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she\\ndo?\\n\\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.\\nShe was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,\\nand to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.\\nShe was born to overcome an affection formed so late\\nin life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship,\\nvoluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,\\na man who had suffered no less than herself under the\\nevent of a former attachment, whom, two years before,\\nshe had considered too old to be married,--and who still\\nsought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\\n\\nBut so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice\\nto an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly\\nflattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining\\neven for ever with her mother, and finding her only\\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her\\nmore calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--\\nshe found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,\\nentering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,\\nthe mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\\n\\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best\\nloved him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he\\nwas consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her\\nsociety restored his mind to animation, and his spirits\\nto cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness\\nin forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight\\nof each observing friend.  Marianne could never love\\nby halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much\\ndevoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.\\n\\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without\\na pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete\\nin the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating\\nhis marriage with a woman of character, as the source\\nof her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have\\nbeen happy and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct,\\nwhich thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,\\nneed not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel\\nBrandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But that\\nhe was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,\\nor contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a\\nbroken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.\\nHe lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.\\nHis wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\\nalways uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable\\ndegree of domestic felicity.\\n\\nFor Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility\\nin surviving her loss--he always retained that decided\\nregard which interested him in every thing that befell her,\\nand made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--\\nand many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in\\nafter-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage,\\nwithout attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for\\nSir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,\\nMargaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,\\nand not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.\\n\\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant\\ncommunication which strong family affection would\\nnaturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness\\nof Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least\\nconsiderable, that though sisters, and living almost within\\nsight of each other, they could live without disagreement\\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n'"
